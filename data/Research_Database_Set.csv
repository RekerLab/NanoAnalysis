Here, robust plasmonically encoded Raman scattering nanoparticles, named Au core-Raman-active molecule-Ag shell-Au shell nanoparticles (CMSS NPs), were synthesized. The as-developed CMSS NPs possess a unique exterior ultrathin Au shell (similar to 2.2 nm thickness) that plays double key roles as an effective wrapping layer as well as a plasmonic enhancing layer, thereby showing not only extraordinary stability against oxidative damages and bioerosion but also outstanding SERS sensitivity because of the stronger in-built electromagnetic field, achieving a significant SERS enhancement factor of 3.3 x 10(8). The results confirm that the individual CMSS NPs show ultrahigh brightness, reproducibility, selectivity, and biocompatibility in single-cell Raman imaging. Moreover, ultrabright in vivo tumor imaging with 1 x 1 mm(2) area can be quickly achieved within 35 s under open-air condition. Furthermore, by secondary plasmonic encoding, the CMSS NPs flexibly serve as nanobeacon to monitor single-cell autophagy with improved accuracy. The CMSS NPs are expected as versatile SERS probes that enable ultrabright, fast, and precise Raman-based bioimaging and clinical bioapplications.",,,,,"Zhu, Junjie/G-5867-2012; Wen, Shengping/D-8794-2012","Wen, Shengping/0000-0002-7907-4445; Su, Yu/0000-0002-4430-9371; Luo, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3899-0105",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,13-Jan,2021,13,1,,,,,135,147,,10.1021/acsami.0c16683,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c16683,,,,,,,,33356115,,,,,WOS:000611066000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is difficult to completely eliminate tumors by single PTT, and the effects of single dose of PTT frequency on the therapeutic outcome of PTT and the multiple PTT-induced immune response in cancer therapy also remain unclear. Here, water-soluble Ag2S nanoparticles (NPs) with optimal particle size (similar to 15 nm) were synthesized and used as the PTT agents. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that Ag2S NPs had good photothermal conversion in response to the irradiation of an 808 nm laser, and the results indicated that the NPs have potential as contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging as well as good biocompatibility. The in vivo results further revealed that the frequency of the Ag2S NP-mediated PTT affected the cancer therapeutic outcome. The increase of frequency efficiently reduced the primary tumor recurrence and alleviated metastasis. The present study suggested that the mechanism involves multiple PTT cycles inhibiting the proliferation of primary tumor cells and stimulating the systematic immune response in the mouse breast cancer model.

Using this approach, we delivered exogenous miR-148b to induce apoptosis in Ras-expressing keratinocytes and murine squamous cell carcinoma cells while avoiding cytotoxicity in untransformed keratinocytes.

Herein, targeting multi-functional hydrophilic nanomicelles, AgBiS2@DSPE-PEG(2000)-FA (ABS-FA), were obtained and employed for tumor treatment. In a cascade amplification mode, ABS-FA exhibited favorable properties of actively enhancing computed tomography/infrared (CT/IR) imaging and gently relieving ambient oxygen concentration by cooperative photothermal and sonodynamic therapy. Compared with traditional Bi2S3 nanoparticles, the CT imaging capability of the probe was augmented (43.21%), and the photothermal conversion efficiency was increased (33.1%). Furthermore, remarkable ultrasonic dynamic features of ABS-FA were observed, with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (24.3%) being obtained compared to Ce6, a commonly used sonosensitizer. Furthermore, ABS-FA exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on HeLa cell migration at 6 mu g/mL, which to some extent, demonstrated its suppressive effect on tumor growth. A lower dose, laser and ultrasonic power, and shorter processing time endowed ABS-FA with excellent photothermal and sonodynamic effects. By mild cascade mode, the hypoxic condition of the tumor site was largely improved, and a suitable oxygen-rich environment was provided, thereby endowing ABS-FA with a superior synergistically enhanced treatment effect compared with the single-mode approach, which ultimately realized the purpose of one injection, multiple treatment. Moreover, our data showed that ABS-FA was given with a biological safety profile while harnessing in vivo. Taken together, as a synergistically enhanced medical diagnosis and treatment method, the one-for-all nanoplatform will pave a new avenue for further clinical applications.",,,,,,"cheng, kai/0000-0002-7918-3465; Liu, Tiancai/0000-0002-2985-3766",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,9-Sep,2020,12,36,,,,,40052,40066,,10.1021/acsami.0c10475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c10475,,,,,,,,32806885,,,,,WOS:000571433500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The synergism is attributed to the effective intratumoral buildup of PAL/HCQ, which otherwise exhibit distinctly different circulatory and biodistribution profile. PAL/HCQ co-delivery nanoparticles lead to the most effective shrinkage of PDAC compared to various controls, including free drug mixture.

AuNPP-FA inhibited tumor proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, and tumor metastasis was controlled in vivo. We also found that, in addition to inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, AuNPP-FA normalized tumor vasculature by increasing pericyte coverage and strengthening tight junctions by upregulating VE-cadherin (VE-cad) levels on endothelial cells. This decreased vascular permeability, improved vascular perfusion, and alleviated tissue hypoxia. The immunotherapeutic response was enhanced due to the increased infiltration of CD3(+)038(+) T lymphocytes. AuNPP-FA increased the expression and secretion of semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) in cancer cells to further inhibit Smad2/3 signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

However, it remains extremely challenging to effectively deliver gas into tissues of interest and unravel its underlying mechanisms. Herein, we designed a near-infrared (NIR) light-switchable nitric oxide (NO) delivery nanosystem for high-efficacy multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal in cancer therapy based on a yolk-shell upconverting nanoparticles@magnesium silica (UCNP@MgSiO3). The internal hollow cavity and flower-like mesoporous shell of UCNPs@MgSiO3 not only enabled a significantly high encapsulation capacity for the NO precursor (BNN6) and doxorubicin (DOX) but also allowed the enhanced cellular uptake, resulting in NIR-triggered NO generation and low pH-triggered DOX release in cancer cells. Mechanistically, intracellular NO can downregulate the drug efflux-related P-glycoprotein and adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette transporters, thereby increasing the DOX accumulation in the cell nuclei. Such combination therapy of NO and DOX induced the apoptosis of MDR cells and completely inhibited in vivo MDR tumor growth. We further elucidated the therapy mechanism via proteomic profiling, showcasing the downregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway in the NO-treated MDR cells.

Bone mineralization is a dynamic process and varies spatiotemporally as a function of cancer-promoting conditions such as age and diet. The functional relationship between skeletal dissemination of tumor cells and bone mineralization, however, is unclear. Standard histological analysis of bone metastasis frequently relies on prior demineralization of bone, while methods that maintain mineral are often harsh and damage fluorophores commonly used to label tumor cells. Here, fluorescent silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are introduced as a robust and versatile labeling strategy to analyze tumor cells within mineralized bone. SNP uptake and labeling efficiency of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is characterized with cryo-scanning electron microscopy and different tissue processing methods. Using a 3D in vitro model of marrow-containing, mineralized bone as well as an in vivo model of bone metastasis, SNPs are demonstrated to allow visualization of labeled tumor cells in mineralized bone using various imaging modalities including widefield, confocal, and light sheet microscopy.

Thus, an intelligent nanocarrier with dynamic size has been explored as a promising approach to fulfill the requirements for both efficient accumulation according to the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effect and deep penetration into tumor tissue. Herein, structure-switchable triplex DNA was modified on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to investigate its potential to modulate the nanoparticle dynamic disassembly process among the tumor microenvironment. We report that the pH-sensitive triplex DNA exhibited outstanding sensitivity and size tunability in triggering the disassembly of AuNP clusters into smaller sizes among the tumor acidic environment, leading to better permeability both in vitro and in vivo. By further combination of the telomerase-sensitive hairpin DNA loaded with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX), a cancer-specific intracellular drug-release function was also realized, resulting in a precise treatment effect and lower toxicity on normal cells. Through comodification of these two structure-switchable DNA chains on AuNPs and construction of nanoparticle assemblies with proper size, programmed disassembly and drug-release function in tissue and cell level, respectively, were successfully combined and eventually facilitated a highly efficient nanodrug transportation process, from tumor accumulation to deep penetration and precise cancer chemotherapy.

In this work, a protocell-like nanoreactor (GOx-MSN@MnPc-LP) has been designed for synergistic starvation therapy and PDT. In this nanoreactor, the hydrophilic glucose oxidase (GOx) is loaded in the pore of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), while the hydrophobic manganese phthaleincyanide (MnPc) is loaded in the membrane layer of liposome. This spatial separation of two payloads protects GOx and MnPc from the cellular environment and avoids interference with each other. GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose, which generates hydrogen peroxide and gluconic acid, leading to the starvation therapy via glucose consumption in cancer cells, as well as the disruption of cellular redox balance. MnPc produces cytotoxic singlet oxygen under 730 nm laser irradiation, achieving PDT. The antitumor effects of the nanoreactor have been verified on tumor cells and tumor-bearing mice models.

Quantum dots (QDs) offer potentially invaluable societal benefits such as drug targeting and in vivo biomedical imaging. In contrast, QDs may also pose risks to human health and the environment under certain conditions. Here, we demonstrated that a unique combination of nanocrystals core components (Ag-In-Zn-S) would eliminate the toxicity problem and increase their biomedical applications. The alloyed quaternary nanocrystals Ag-In-Zn-S (QD(green), Ag1.0In1.2Zn5.6S9.4; QD(red), Ag1.0In1.0Zn1.0S3.5) were used to transport new unsymmetrical bisacridine derivatives (UAs, C-2028 and C-2045) into lung H460 and colon HCT116 cancer cells for improving the cytotoxic and antitumor action of these compounds. UAs were coupled with QD through physical adsorption. The obtained results clearly indicate that the synthesized nanoconjugates exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than unbound compounds, especially toward lung H460 cancer cells. Importantly, unsymmetrical bisacridines noncovalently attached to QD strongly protect normal cells from the drug action. It is worth pointing out that QD(green) or QD(red) without UAs did not influence the growth of cancer and normal cells, which is consistent with in vivo results. In noncellular systems, at pH 5.5 and 4.0, which relates to the conditions of endosomes and lysosomes, the UAs were released from QD-UAs nanoconjugates. An increase of total lysosomes content was observed in H460 cells treated with QDs-UAs which can affect the release of the UAs from the conjugates. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses revealed that QD-UAs nanoconjugates enter H460 cells more efficiently than to HCT116 and normal cells, which may be the reason for their higher cytotoxicity against lung cancer. Summarizing, the noncovalent attachment of UAs to QDs increases the therapeutic efficiency of UAs by improving cytotoxicity toward lung H460 cancer cells and having protecting effects on normal cells.",,,,,"Augustin, Ewa/H-5781-2018","Augustin, Ewa/0000-0002-0807-021X; Nowicka, Anna/0000-0002-5872-6010; Pilch, Joanna/0000-0003-3476-2540; Kowalczyk, Agata/0000-0002-1911-8311; Bujak, Piotr/0000-0003-2162-961X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,15-Apr,2020,12,15,,,,,17276,17289,,10.1021/acsami.0c02621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c02621,,,,,,,,32208730,,,,,WOS:000526330900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this issue, we herein report a two-step sequential delivery strategy for targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine (GEM). In this sequential strategy, metformin (MET) was first administrated to disrupt the dense stroma, based on the fact that MET downregulated the expression of fibrogenic cytokine TGF-beta to suppress the activity of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), through the 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells. In consequence, the PSC-mediated desmoplastic reactions generating alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen were inhibited, which promoted the delivery of GEM and pH (low) insertion peptide (pHLIP) comodified magnetic nanoparticles (denoted as GEM-MNP-pHLIP). In addition, pHLIP largely increased the binding affinity of the nanodrug to PANC-1 cells. The targeted delivery and effective accumulation of MET/GEM-MNP-pHLIP in vivo were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging enhanced by the underlying magnetic nanoparticles. The tumor growth inhibition of the sequential MET and GEM-MNP-pHLIP treatment were investigated on both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor mice models. A remarkably improved therapeutic efficacy, for example, up to 91.2% growth inhibition ratio over 30 d of treatment, well-exemplified the novel cascade treatment for pancreatic cancer and the innovative use of MET.",,,,,", Gao MY/ABC-2193-2021; chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; chen, xin/IQW-3432-2023; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022","gao, ming yuan/0000-0002-7360-3684",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,1520-5126,,,,11-Mar,2020,142,10,,,,,4944,4954,,10.1021/jacs.0c00650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c00650,,,,,,,,32069041,,,,,WOS:000526392200052,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, its instability in physicochemical environments and its severe toxicity confined its further application. To overcome this, herein, we demonstrated a silver prism- polydopamine (PDA) hybrid nanoplatform for tumor treatment with three therapeutic strategies. Specifically, the PDA coating endows the silver prism with excellent stability, high photothermal conversion, long-term in vivo biocompatibility, ease of decorating targeting ligands, and drug delivery. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation (808 nm, 1 W/cm(2)), tumors can be eradicated by the as-prepared nanoparticle through monomodal PTT. Besides, when combined with a chemical drug, this nanoparticle is able to inhibit tumor growth via combined photochemotherapy under a lower laser treatment (0.7 W/cm(2)). Furthermore, by supplementing with an immune checkpoint blockade, the realized synergistic photochemoimmunotherapy exhibits high efficacy to inhibit tumor relapse and metastasis. Moreover, owing to the high photothermal conversion efficiency and great X-ray attenuation ability of the silver nanoprism, our designed nanoplatform can be used in photoacoustic, computed tomography, and infrared thermal multimodal imaging.

Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed that amplified ROS generation was the dominant factor in provoking a strong immune response at a physiological tolerable temperature below 40 degrees C in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This was supported by the exposure of calreticulin (CRT) on 83% of the 4T1 breast cancer cell surface, direct promotion of macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory MI phenotypes, and further elevation of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes.

Passion fruit-like Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles were fabricated by considerable freshly-urinary Exos loaded efficiently with multi-functionalized PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanoparticles via instant electroporation strategy. In this system, prepared Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles could be internalized into cancer cells effectively, and could delay the endocytosis of macrophages and prolong blood circulation time owing to its membrane structure and antigens. Under 633?nm laser irradiation and acidic condition, the structures of nanovehicles would be collapsed and tremendous PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanoparticles could be released inside cancer cells, produced considerable singlet oxygen, inhibiting growth of tumor cells. In vivo experiment of MGC-803 tumor-bearing nude mice showed that prepared Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles could target tumor cells with deep penetration and superior retention performance in tumors. This work reports a reliable conjugation-free labeling strategy for tracking exosomes harvested from human urine. Moreover, the integration of multifunctional nanoparticles with urinary Exos paves a versatile road for the development of cancer-targeted photodynamic therapy.",,,,,"Huang, Zhicheng/GRF-0932-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-9612,1878-5905,,,,FEB,2020,230,,,,,,,,119606,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119606,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.119606,,,,,,,,31806405,,,,,WOS:000508746600025,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, clinical use of siRNA/miRNA combinations is limited by the availability of safe and efficient systemic delivery systems with sufficient tumor penetrating and endosomal escaping capabilities. This study reports on the development of multifunctional tumor-penetrating mesoporous silica nanoparticles (iMSNs) for simultaneous delivery of siRNA (siPlk1) and miRNA (miR-200c), using encapsulation of a photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) to facilitate endosomal escape and surface conjugation of the iRGD peptide to enable deep tumor penetration. Increased cell uptake of the nanoparticles was observed in both 3D tumor spheroids in vitro and in orthotopic MDA-MB-231 breast tumors in vivo. Using a galectin-8 recruitment assay, we showed that reactive oxygen species generated by ICG upon light irradiation functioned as an endosomolytic stimulus that caused release of the siRNA/miRNA combination from endosomes. Co-delivery of the therapeutic RNAs displayed combined cell killing activity in cancer cells. Systemic intravenous treatment of metastatic breast cancer with the iMSNs loaded with siPlk1 and miR-200c resulted in a significant suppression of the primary tumor growth and in marked reduction of metastasis upon short light irradiation of the primary tumor.

The incorporation of TNF-alpha into exosomes and the conjugation of SPIONs significantly enhanced the binding capacity of TNF-alpha to its membrane-bound receptor TNFR I, thus increasing the therapeutic effects. CTNF-alpha-exosome-SPIONs significantly enhanced tumor cell growth inhibition via induction of the TNFR I-mediated apoptotic pathway.

To date, PDT drugs are injected systemically, and the tumor area is irradiated to induce cell death. Current clinical protocols have several drawbacks, including limited accessibility to solid tumors and insufficient selectivity of drugs. Herein, we propose an alternative approach to improve PDT effectiveness by magnetic targeting of responsive carriers conjugated to the PDT drug. We coordinatively attached a meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC) photosensitizer to Ce-doped-gamma-Fe2O3 maghemite nanoparticles (MNPs). These MNPs are superparamagnetic and biocompatible, and the resulting mTHPC-MNPs nanocomposites are stable in aqueous suspensions. MDA-MB231 (human breast cancer) cells incubated with the mTHPC-MNPs showed high uptake and high death rates in cell population after PDT. The exposure to external magnetic forces during the incubation period directed the nanocomposites to selected sites enhancing drug accumulation that was double that of cells with no magnetic exposure. Next, breast cancer tumors were induced subcutaneously in mice and treated magnetically. In vivo results showed accelerated drug accumulation in tumors of mice injected with mTHPC-MNP nanocomposites, compared to the free drug. PDT irradiation led to a decrease in tumor size of both groups, whereas treatment with the focused magnetic nanocomposites led to significant tumor regression. Our results demonstrate a method to improve the current PDT treatments by applying magnetic forces to effectively direct the drug to cancerous tissue. This approach leads to a highly localized and effective PDT process, opening new directions for clinical PDT protocols.",,,,,,"Shefi, Orit/0000-0001-6680-7390; Atkins, Ayelet/0000-0001-9060-9298",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,11-Dec,2019,11,49,,,,,45368,45380,,10.1021/acsami.9b14060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b14060,,,,,,,,31755692,,,,,WOS:000502689000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, we report on the construction of photothermal-enhanced and nanocatalyst-enabled sequential catalytic reaction for TME-specific cancer therapy. This conceptual advance is achieved by engineering the surface of two-dimensional Ti3C2 MXene with two separate catalysts, including natural glucose oxidase (GOD) as glucose catalysts and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as Fenton-reaction nanocatalysts. A sequential catalytic reaction is triggered by using GOD for catalyzing the tumor-overtaken glucose to generate large amounts of hydrogen peroxide molecules. Subsequently IONPs can catalyze the transformation of pregenerated hydrogen peroxide into large amounts of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals to kill the cancer cells subsequently in TME-enabled acidity condition. The two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 MXene matrix efficiently converts the near-infrared light into thermal energy to synergistically enhance the catalytic efficiency of this sequential catalytic reaction and therefore achieve the high synergistic cancer-therapeutic outcome, accompanied with the high biocompatibility of the constructed composite nanocatalysts. Both in vitro cancer-cell evaluation and in vivo tumor xenograft on nude mice with complete tumor eradication demonstrate the high synergistic efficiency of photothermal-enhanced sequential nanocatalytic cancer therapy.

Here we report an outer-frame-degradable nanovehicle featuring near-infrared (NIR) dual luminescence for real-time tracking of protein delivery in vivo. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and fluorophore-doped degradable macroporous silica (DS) with spectral overlap were coupled to form a core shell nanostructure as a therapeutic protein nanocarrier, which was eventually enveloped with a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell to prevent protein leakage and for recognizing tumor sites. The DS layer served as both a container to accommodate the therapeutic proteins and a filter to attenuate upconversion luminescence (UCL) of the inner UCNPs. After the nanovehicles selectively accumulated at tumor sites and entered cancer cells, intracellular hyaluronidase (HAase) digested the outermost HA protective shell and initiated the outer frame degradation-induced protein release and UCL restoration of UCNPs in the intracellular environment. Significantly, the biodistribution of the nanovehicles can be traced at the 710 nm NIR fluorescence channel of DS, whereas the protein release can be monitored at the 660 nm NIR fluorescence channel of UCNPs. Real-time tracking of protein delivery and release was achieved in vitro and in vivo by NIR fluorescence imaging. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies manifest that the protein cytochrome c-loaded nanovehicles exhibited excellent cancer therapeutic efficacy.

The nanoagent system is facilely prepared using a DNA complex to modify gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The DNA complex is formed by three oligonucleotides (ATP aptamer, rC-DNA, and rG-DNA). The CG-rich structure in a ternary DNA complex could be exploited for payload of chemotherapeutic medicine doxorubicin (DOX), thus making efficient DOX transport into the tumor site possible. In tumor cells, especially in acidic organelles (e.g., endosome and lysosome), DOX could be rapidly released via the dual stimuli of overexpressed ATP and pH. What is more, the specific recognition of a fluorescently labeled aptamer strand to ATP can achieve the intracellular ATP imaging. pH-controlled reversible folding and unfolding of intermolecular i-motif formed by C-rich strands can lead to intracellular in situ assembly of AuNP aggregates with high photothermal conversion efficiency and promote relatively facile renal clearance of AuNPs through the disassociation of the aggregates in extracellular environments.

Furthermore, the in vivo anticancer study revealed that the growth of solid tumor models could be suppressed remarkably after treating with FMDF NPs and no obvious damage to other major organs.

Stimulus-responsive nanoplatforms can target and regulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) for the optimization of cancer theranostics. Here, we developed magnetic manganese oxide sweetgum-ball nanospheres (MMOSs) with large mesopores as tools for improved cancer theranostics. MMOSs contain magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and mesoporous manganese oxide (MnO2) nanosheets, which are assembled into gumball-like structures on magnetic iron oxides. The large mesopores of MMOSs are suited for cargo loading with chlorin e6 (Ce6) and doxorubicin (DOX), thus producing so-called CD@MMOSs. The core of magnetic iron oxides could achieve magnetic targeting of tumors under a magnetic field (0.25 mT), and the targeted CD@MMOSs may decompose under TME conditions, thereby releasing loaded cargo molecules and reacting with endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate oxygen (O-2) and manganese (II) ions (Mn2+). Investigation in vivo in tumor-bearing mice models showed that the CD@MMOS nanoplatforms achieved TME-responsive cargo release, which might be applied in chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. A remarkable in vivo synergy of diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities was achieved by the decomposition of CD@MMOSs and coadministration with chemo-photodynamic therapy of tumors using the magnetic targeting mechanism.

Although nanomaterial-based drug delivery has been used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, inferior targeting ability of existing nanocarriers leads to inefficient treatment and side effects. Moreover, the majority of intravenously administered nanomaterials aggregate into the reticuloendothelial system, leaving a certain hidden risk to human health. All those problems gave great demands for further construction of well-performed and biocompatible nanomaterials for in vivo theranostics.

Through the background-free persistent luminescence bioimaging of ZGGO, the coating of LRM facilitated the localization of ZGGO@SiO2@LRM to the tumor area of colorectum for more than 24 h after intragastric administration. Furthermore, ZGGO@SiO2@LRM hardly entered the blood, which avoided possible damage to immune organs such as the liver and spleen. In vivo chemotherapy experiment demonstrated the number of tumors per mouse in ZGGO@SiO2@LRM group decreased by one-half compared with the 5-FU group (P < 0.001). To sum up, this LRM bioinspired nanoparticles could tolerate the digestion of gastric acid, avoid aggregation by the immune system, favor gut-oriented drug delivery, and targeted release oral 5-FU into colorectum for more than 24 h, which may give new application prospects for targeted delivery of oral drugs into the colorectum.",,,,,"Wang, Zhi-Hao/HSG-1158-2023; Liu, JingMin/P-6729-2014; Wang, Zhi-Hao/GPX-9377-2022","Liu, JingMin/0000-0002-0644-6527; Wang, Zhi-Hao/0000-0001-9722-0429",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,9-Oct,2019,11,40,,,,,36409,36419,,10.1021/acsami.9b12853,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b12853,,,,,,,,31525949,,,,,WOS:000490357900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, we have demonstrated the use of a second window near-infrared (NIR(II)) photothermal treatment to trigger more homogeneous and deeper immunogenic cancer cell death in solid tumors, thereby eliciting both innate and adaptive immune responses for tumor control and metastasis prevention. Specifically, photothermal transducers with similar components, structures, and photothermal conversion efficiencies, but different absorptions in red light, NIR(I), and NIR(II) biowindows, were constructed by controlling the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles on fluidic liposomes. In vitro, photothermal treatments induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) that were accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) regardless of the wavelength of incident lasers. In vivo, NIR(II) light resulted in a more homogeneous release and distribution of DAMPs in the deeper parts of the tumors. With the induction of ICD, NIR(II) photothermal therapy simultaneously triggered both innate and adaptive immune responses and enabled efficient tumor control with 5/8 of the mice remaining tumor-free in the cancer vaccination assay. Additionally, the NIR(II) photothermal treatment in combination with checkpoint blockade therapy exerted long-term tumor control over both primary and distant tumors.

Since polyethylenimine (PEI)-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are bioactive nanosystems that modulate inflammatory macrophage responses and limit tumor cell invasion, we evaluated their effects on endothelial cell angiogenesis. PEI-SPION triggered proinflammatory gene profiles in a murine endothelial cell line and in primary human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These nanoparticles impaired endothelial cell migration and inhibited HUVEC tube formation. Magnetically tumor-targeted PEI-SPIONs reduced tumor vessel numbers and promoted intratumor macrophage infiltration in a tumor xenograft model. PEI-SPION treatment impaired M2 macrophage-promoted tube formation and affected HUVEC cytoskeleton by limiting Src and Cortactin activation. These mechanisms could contribute to PEI-SPION in vitro and in vivo antiangiogenic potential. These data confirm that PEI-SPION administration and application of a localized magnetic field could offer an affordable anti-angiogenic anti-tumoral targeted treatment that would complement other therapies.

Image-based strategies for in vivo monitoring are advantageous because they are non-invasive and provide visualization of the spatial distribution of drug, but those imaging modalities in use (e.g., fluorescence imaging (FI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) remain inadequate because of the low tissue penetration depth (for FI) or difficulty with quantification of release rate and signal convolution with noise sources (for MRI). Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), employing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as the contrast agent and sole signal source, enables large tissue penetration and quantifiable signal intensity. These properties make it ideal for application to in vivo drug release monitoring. In this work, we design a superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanocluster@poly(lactide-co-glycolide acid) core-shell nanocomposite loaded with a chemotherapy drug (doxorubicin) which serves as a dual drug delivery system and MPI quantification tracer. The as-prepared nanocomposite can degrade under a mild acidic microenvironment (pH = 6.5), which induces a sustained release of doxorubicin and gradual decomposition of the Fe3O4 nanocluster, causing the MPI signal changes. We showed that nanocomposite-induced MPI signal changes display a linear correlation with the release rate of doxorubicin over time (R-2 = 0.99). Utilizing this phenomenon, we successfully established quantitative monitoring of the release process in cell culture. We then performed in vivo drug release monitoring in a cancer therapy setting using a murine breast cancer model by injecting the nanocomposite, monitoring the drug release, and assessing the induced tumor cell kill. This study provides an improved solution for in vivo drug release monitoring compared to other available monitoring strategies.

These gold nanoparticles showed electric neutrality at pH 7.4 (hematological system) to prevent endocytosis of normal cells, which could be positively charged at pH 6.8 (tumor microenvironment) to promote the endocytosis of tumor cells to these nanoparticles, performing great tumor selectivity.

The NPs were also tested for photothermal property, optical droplet vaporization (ODV) capacity and the ability of aPD1 release profile. In vivo, GOP@aPD1 NPs were systemically administered to melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated no toxicity and accumulation at tumor site. When mediated with PTT, this synergistic treatment achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy, due to combination of the effective aPD1 release and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor site.

Cu2+-doped, DSF-loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles were constructed for the rapid release of Cu2+ ions induced by the mild acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment. This resulted in the rapid biodegradation of the nanoparticles and accelerated DSF release once the particles were endocytosed into tumor cells. The resulting in situ chelation reaction between the coreleased Cu2+ ions and DSF generated toxic CuET products and concurrently, Fenton-like reactions between the generated Cu+ ions and the high levels of H2O2 resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the acidic tumor microenvironment.

Furthermore, glutathione (GSH, an antioxidant) is overexpressed in cancer cells, which can scavenge the generated ROS, thus lowering PDT efficacy. Herein, ultralow-intensity near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered PDT was developed and enhanced through combined GSH-depletion chemotherapy (Chemo) based on exo- and endogenous synergistic effects. Highly emissive upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were prepared and coated with a solid silica shell, which was used to encapsulate the PS rose bengal and bond the drug camptothecin with a disulfide-bond linker. The combination of highly emissive UCNPs and a matchable PS with an optimized loading dosage enabled ROS to be generated for PDT even upon 808 nm laser irradiation with ultralow intensity (0.30 W cm(-2)). According to the American National Standard, this laser intensity is below the maximum permissible exposure of skin (MPE, 0.33 W cm(-2)). Once the prepared nanoparticles endocytosed and encountered intracellular GSH, the disulfide-bond linker was cleaved by GSH, leading to drug release and GSH depletion. PDT was therefore simultaneously enhanced through the exogenous synergic effect of Chemo (namely, the 1 + 1 > 2 therapeutic effect) and the endogenous synergic effect as a result of GSH depletion. It was proven both in vitro and in vivo that this novel dual-synergistic Chemo/PDT system exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy with minimal photodamage to healthy neighboring cells.",,,,,"ZHU, BIN/IYJ-3847-2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,21-Jul,2019,11,27,,,,,13078,13088,,10.1039/c9nr03052b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9nr03052b,,,,,,,,31265049,,,,,WOS:000475482200034,View Full Record in Web of Science

We showed that silica nanoparticles can efficiently deliver miR-34a into normal and cancer epithelial cells grown in culture without major signs of toxicity. Delivered miRNA retained the ability to silence artificial as well endogenous targets and can reduce the growth of mammospheres in 3D culture.

To avoid destruction of the bone matrix, current treatments focus on inhibiting the cancer cell growth and the osteoclast activity through combination therapy.

We have developed a multifunctional three-dimensional tumor-targeting drug delivery system, Fe3O4@UIO-66-NH2/graphdiyne (FUGY), based on the hybridization of a novel two-dimensional material, graphdiyne (GDY), with a metal organic framework (MOFs) structure, Fe3O4@UIO-66-NH2 (FU). The FU MOF structure has superior ability for magnetic targeting, and was constructed by an in situ growth method in which it was surface-installed with GDY via amide bonds, as a carrier of anticancer drugs. The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded onto FUGY and served as both an anticancer drug to treat the tumor and a fluorescence probe to ascertain the location of FUGY. The results show that FUGY exhibits a high drug loading content of 43.8% and an effective drug release around the tumor cells at pH 5.0. In particular, fluorescence imaging demonstrates that FUGY can deliver more anticancer drugs to tumor tissue than conventional drug delivery systems. Furthermore, FUGY exhibits superior therapeutic efficiencies with negligible side effects as compared to the direct administration of free DOX, both in vitro and in vivo. The obtained FUGY drug delivery system possesses ideal biocompatibility, sustained drug release, effective chemotherapeutic efficacy, and specific targeting abilities.

Confocal imaging and flow cytometry analysis further proved that the nanocarriers can efficiently enter cells and complete intracellular DOX release under the low pH and high glutathione concentrations, which resulted in an enhanced cytotoxicity of DOX for cancer cells. Meanwhile, subcellular localization experiments revealed that the ZDOS NPs entered cells mainly by endocytosis and then escaped from lysosomes into the cytosol. Moreover, in vivo assays also demonstrated that the ZDOS NPs exhibited negligible systemic toxicity and significantly enhanced anticancer efficiencies compared with free DOX.

Tumor recurrence is often attributed to the presence of a subpopulation of cells with stem cell properties, referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Traditionally, cancer therapies target the entire bulk of tumor cells; however, they are poorly effective against CSCs, characterized by higher drug resistance. Therefore, approaches targeting CSCs may be required in addition to conventional chemotherapy to prevent tumor recurrence. In this study, we investigated an approach to target HCC by combining the conventional chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, to target the bulk of tumor cells, and differentiation therapy by delivering the gene encoding HNF4 alpha, an important regulator of hepatocyte differentiation, to target CSCs. We used the Huh7 cell line as an in vitro model of HCC, which is characterized by a high proportion of CD133-expressing CSCs. By using flow cytometry, we separated CD133(+) and CD133(-) Huh7 cell subpopulations and have shown that the former has highly pronounced in vivo tumorigenic capacity in contrast to the latter, which could not generate tumors in vivo. For the dual delivery of HNF4 alpha-encoding plasmid and cisplatin, we used polyethyleneimine-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PMSNs) as the nanocarriers. Here, we show that the treatment of CD133-expressing Huh7 cells with HNF4 alpha-loaded PMSNs can suppress their proliferation rate, decrease the proportion of CSCs, downregulate sternness-associated genes, and increase the expression of mature hepatocyte-associated genes. At the same time, the treatment of Huh7 with PMSNs loaded with both HNF4 alpha-encoding plasmid and cisplatin could block them in the S-phase of the cell cycle and cause apoptosis. In addition, dually loaded PMSNs were the most efficient formulation in suppressing tumor growth in vivo. To summarize, in this study, we tested the nanoparticle-based delivery system as both chemotherapy and gene-based therapy agents, which has great potential for development of effective treatment of HCC.",,,,,"Chen, Wei/M-4793-2019","Chen, Wei/0000-0002-2909-3023; MOU, CHUNG-YUAN/0000-0001-7060-9899",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,5-Jun,2019,11,22,,,,,19808,19818,,10.1021/acsami.9b04474,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b04474,,,,,,,,31066542,,,,,WOS:000470938500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the standalone GOx delivery suffered suboptimal potency for tumor elimination and potential risks of damaging vasculatures and normal organs during transportation. To enhance therapeutic efficacy and tumor specificity, a site-specific activated dual-catalytic nanoreactor was herein constructed by embedding GOx and ferrocene in hyaluronic acid (HA)-enveloped dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles to promote intratumoral oxidative stress in cancer starvation. In this nanoreactor, the encapsulated GOx served as the primary catalyst that accelerated oxidation of glucose and generation of H2O2, while the covalently linked ferrocene worked as the secondary catalyst for converting the upstream H2O2 to more toxic hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) via a classic Fenton reaction. The outmost HA shell not only offered a shielding layer for preventing blood glucose from oxidation during nanoreactor transportation, thus minimizing the probable oxidative damage to normal tissues, but also imparted the nanoreactor with targeting ability for facilitating its internalization into CD44-overexpressing tumor cells. After the nanoreactor was endocytosed by target cells, the HA shell underwent hyaluronidase-triggered degradation in lysosomes and switched on the cascade catalytic reaction mediated by GOx and ferrocene. The resulting glucose exhaustion and (OH)-O-center dot accumulation would effectively kill cancer cells and suppress tumor growth via combination of starvation and oxidative stress enhancement.

FHCPCe NPs have high physiological stability and good biocompatibility, and can enhance accumulation in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Meanwhile, the FHCPCe NPs exhibit an effective performance of dual-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to the Fe3O4 cores and fluorescence imaging (FL) in the xenografted HeLa tumor because of the fluorescence of Ce6.

However, most of the theranostics systems suffer from poor targeting activity, insensitive diagnosis and drug leakage, leading to poor treatment results. In this study, a hierarchical tumor acidity-responsive magnetic nanobomb (termed HTAMN) was developed for photodynamic therapy and diagnostic imaging. The HTAMNs were formed through the self-assembly of chlorin e6 (Ce6)-functionalized polypeptide ligand, methoxy poly (ethyleneglycol)-block-poly (dopamineethylenediamine-2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride)-L-glutamate-Ce6 [mPEG-b-P (Dopa-Ethy-DMMA)LG-Ce6] and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Negatively charged HTAMNs circulate in the blood for prolonged periods and promote tumor retention by passive targeting to the tumor. Once the HTAMNs arrive at the tumor location, the acidic extracellular tumor environment reverses the surface charge of the HTAMNs, resulting in tumor accumulation and cellular uptake. Moreover, in response to the more acidic environment inside cells, the photosensitizers are activated resulted in enhanced diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment. The in vitro and in vivo results indicate the effective tumor accumulation, internalization, diagnostic sensitivity and superior photodynamic therapy effect of the HTAMNs.

In this study, a general and rapid synthesis method is presented that can achieve large-scale preparation of monodisperse and uniform silicate nanoscintillators. By simply adjusting the metal dopants, silicate nanoscintillators with controllable size and X-ray-excited optical luminescence (450-900 nm) are synthesized by employing a general ion-incorporated silica-templating method.

This nanoparticle-assisted cell-reprogramming strategy demonstrates profound advantages, due to the combined contributions from the biological regulation of HIONs and the intrinsic nature of macrophages. Firstly, the reprogrammed macrophages present a substantial improvement in their innate capabilities, such as more effective tumor targeting and more efficient generation of bioactive components (e.g., reactive oxygen species, bioactive cytokines) to suppress tumor growth.

However, the receptor overexpression level varies between different types or stages of tumors. Thus, it is essential to explore the influence of ligand valency on the targeting ability of MLNs to tumors with different levels of receptor overexpression. In this study, a dual-acting agent raltitrexed was used as a ligand to target the folate receptor (FR). Different copies of the raltitrexed-modified multivalent dendritic polyethyleneimine ligand cluster PRn (n = 2,4, and 8) were conjugated onto magnetic nanoparticles to form multivalent magnetic NPs (MMNs) with different valences. The in vitro studies demonstrated that Fe- PR4 was the most effective valency in the treatment of high FR overexpressing KB cells with a decentralized receptor distribution, owing to the fact that Fe-PR2 was negative in statistical rebinding and Fe-PR8 could induce steric hindrance in the limited binding area. Instead, in moderate FR overexpressing HeLa cells with clustered receptor display, the extra ligands on Fe-PR8 would facilitate statistical rebinding more beneficially. Furthermore, in in vivo tumor inhibition and targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of KB tumors and another moderate FR expressing H22 tumor, similar results were obtained with the cell experiments.

However, the environmental instability accompanied by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) seriously hindered the bioapplications of BPQDs, especially in oxygen-dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT). Here, we construct a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific targeting aptamer TLS11a-decorated BPQDs-hybridized nanocatalyst, which can specifically target HCC tumor cells and self-compensate oxygen (O-2) into hypoxic TME for enhancing PDT efficiency. The BPQD-hybridized mesoporous silica framework (BMSF) with in situ synthesized Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) in the BMSF is simply prepared. After being decorated by TLS11a aptamer/Mal-PEG-NHS, the resultant nanosystem (refer as Apt-BMSF@Pt) exhibits excellent environmental stability, active targeting ability to HCC cells, and self-compensation ability of oxygen.

In a mouse model, the Apt-BMSF@Pt can effectively accumulate into tumor sites, and the core of BMSF subsequently can act as a photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species, while the PtNPs can serve as a catalyst to convert O-2 into O-2 for enhancing PDT through self-compensation mechanisms in hypoxic TME. By comparison of the tumor volume/weight, H&E, and immunohistochemical analysis, the excellent antitumor effects with minimized side effects of our Apt-BMSF@Pt could be demonstrated in vivo.

It is thus desirable to develop oral therapy systems for the local treatment of colon cancers featured with highly selective delivery to cancer cells and minimized systemic drug absorption. The present study demonstrates the effective accumulation and cell uptake of the doxorubicin and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles-loaded solid lipid nano particle (SLN) delivery system for chemo/magnetothermal combination therapy at tumors by hierarchical targeting of folate (FA) and dextran coated on SLN surfaces in a sequential layer-by-layer manner. Both the in vitro and in vivo characterizations strongly confirmed that the dextran shells on SLN surfaces not only retarded the cellular transport of the FA-coated SLNs by the proton-coupled FA transporter on brush border membranes in small intestine, but also enhanced the particle residence in colon by specific association with dextranase. The enzymatic degradation and removal of dextran coating led to the exposure of the FA residues, thereby further facilitating the cellular-level targeting and uptake of the SLNs by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. The evaluation of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the hierarchically targetable SLN therapy system by oral administration showed the effective inhibition of primary colon tumors and peritoneal metastasis in terms of the ascites volume and tumor nodule number and size, along with the absence of systemic side effects.",,,,,"Liu, Te-I/P-8196-2019","Liu, Te-I/0000-0003-0127-3003; Chiu, Hsin-Cheng/0000-0001-5509-2107; Chen, Hsin-Hung/0000-0002-2985-6457; Chiang, Wen-Hsuan/0000-0002-2022-0858",,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-9612,1878-5905,,,,MAR,2019,197,,,,,,86,100,,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.01.019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.01.019,,,,,,,,30641267,,,,,WOS:000459363800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

To expand the boundary of galvanic-replacement-mediated synthesis, we have become interested in the Group 9 metallic element Ir, which is considered a fascinating element in the field of catalysis, but whose size and shape regulation has been conventionally regarded as difficult. To overcome the current limitations, we developed a hydrothermal galvanic-replacement-tethered synthetic route to prepare Ir-Ag-IrO2 nanoplates (IrNPs) with a transverse length of tens of nanometers and a rough surface morphology. A very interesting photoreactivity was observed from the prepared IrNPs, with Ag and IrO2 coexisting partially, which showed photothermal conversion and photocatalytic activity at different ratios against extinction wavelengths of 473, 660, and 808 nm.

Polymer-engraftment of gold nanoparticles has been investigated to achieve the plasmonic coupling phenomenon, but complex chemical steps are often needed to accomplish a biomedically relevant product. An appealing and controllable manner of achieving polymer-based plasmon coupling is a template-assisted Au+3 reduction that ensures in situ gold reduction and coalescence.

In this project, we coated rodlike mesoporous silica with gold nanoshells (MSNR@Au hybrid), modifying them with ultrasmall gadolinium (Gd)-chelated supramolecular photosensitizers, TPPS4 (MSNR@Au-TPPS4(Gd)), which could be applied to near-infrared fluorescence/multispectral optoacoustic tomography/computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and imaging-guided remotely controlled photothermal (PTT)/photodynamic (PDT) combined antitumor therapy.

Compared with conventional PSs, supraPSs have host screens, which could reduce the self-aggregation of TPPS4, and consequently generate O-1(2) with high efficiency. The in vivo quadmodal imaging of MSNR@Au-TPPS4(Gd) nanoparticles revealed an intensive tumor uptake effect after injection.

In this study, we have engineered magnetic thermoresponsive iron oxide nanocubes (TR-cubes) to merge MH treatment with heat-mediated drug delivery, having in mind the clinical translation of the nanoplatform. We have chosen iron oxide based nanoparticles with a cubic shape because of their outstanding heat performance under MH clinical conditions, which makes them benchmark agents for MH. Accomplishing a surface-initiated polymerization of strongly interactive nanoparticles such as our iron oxide nanocubes, however, remains the main challenge to overcome. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to accelerate the growth of a polymer shell on each nanocube by simple irradiation of a copper mediated polymerization with a ultraviolet light (UV) light, which both speeds up the polymerization and prevents nanocube aggregation. Moreover, we demonstrate herein that these TR-cubes can carry chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOXO-loaded-TR-cubes) without compromising their thermoresponsiveness both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo efficacy studies showed complete tumor suppression and the highest survival rate for animals that had been treated with DOXO-loaded-TR-cubes, only when they were exposed to MH. The biodistribution of intravenously injected TR-cubes showed signs of renal clearance within 1 week and complete clearance after 5 months.

A SO2 prodrug-loaded rattle-structured upconversion@silica nanoparticles (RUCSNs) was constructed to enable high loading capacity without obvious leakage and to convert NIR light into ultraviolet light so as to activate the prodrug for SO2 generation. In addition, SO2 prodrug-loaded RUCSNs showed high cell uptake, good biocompatibility, intracellular tracking ability, and high NIR light-triggered cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the cytotoxic SO2 was found to induce cell apoptosis accompanied by the increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and the damage of nuclear DNA. Moreover, efficient inhibition of tumor growth was achieved, associated with significantly prolonged survival of mice.

Fe3O4 nanoparticles decorated on the surface of MnSiO3 could effectively obstruct the pores of MnSiO3 and reduce the leakage of anticancer drugs under physiological conditions. The structure of the nanoplatform was broken under the weakly acidic and high-concentration glutathione conditions in the TME, resulting in the separation of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles from the nanoplatform and rapid drug release.

Furthermore, during the exfoliation process of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals, the catalytic activity of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals toward a Fenton-like reaction within cancer cells could be improved because of the increase in specific surface area, which led to the generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals and induced HeLa cell apoptosis.

Also, the HER2-targeting magnetosomes significantly enhanced the MR imaging of orthotopic breast cancer models with or without HER2 expression using a 7.0 T scanner. In particular, tumors overexpressing HER2 demonstrated better MR imaging than HER2-negative tumors after intravenous administration of HER2-targeting magnetosomes, and the MR signals of the augmented contrast could be detected from 3 to 24 h.

Remarkably, nanoparticles are mainly aggregated in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in vitro and largely accumulated in the tumor in vivo 24 h after injection. Under the guidance of tri-modality imaging, preoperative NPTT could shrink the tumor in a short time and make the boundary between the tumor and surrounding normal tissues clearer, which is conducive to subsequent surgery resection.

Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are the precursors of CAFs in PDAC that secrete abundant extracellular matrix, growth factors and cytokines. In this study, we targeted human relaxin-2 (RLX), an endogenous hormone, to PSCs to inhibit their differentiation into CAF-like myofibroblasts. RLX significantly inhibited TGF-beta induced PSCs differentiation by inhibiting pSmad2 signaling pathway. In vitro in primary human PSCs (hPSCs), treatment with RLX dose-dependently inhibited the migration, contraction, and protein expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and collagen I These data demonstrate that RLX can regulate hPSCs activation in vitro. However, RLX has several drawbacks i.e. poor pharmacokinetics and systemic vasodilation, that limits its preclinical and clinical application. Thus, we designed and successfully synthesized a nanoparticle system by chemically conjugating RLX to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) to improve its pharmacokinetics. Interestingly, we found RLX-SPION to be more efficacious compared to free RLX in vitro. Significantly, we observed RLX-SPION retarded the tumor growth by itself and also potentiated the effect of gemcitabine in a subcutaneous co-injection (Panc1 and hPSCs) tumor model. The treatment resulted in significant inhibition in tumor growth, which was attributed to reduced collagen I (ECM), desmin (hPSC marker) and CD31 (endothelial marker) expression. In contrast, free RLX showed no significant effects.

Extensive evidence suggests that the inhibition of over-expressed oncogenic miRNA function can be a robust strategy for anticancer therapy. However, in vivo targeted delivery of miRNA therapeutics to various types of cancers remains a major challenge. Inspired by their natural synthesis and cargo delivery capabilities, researchers have exploited tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) for the cancer-targeted delivery of therapeutics and theranostics. Here, we investigate a TEV-based nanoplatform for multimodal miRNA delivery and phototherapy treatments as well as the magnetic resonance imaging of cancer. We demonstrated loading of anti-miR-21 that blocks the function of endogenous oncogenic miR-21 over-expressed in cancer cells into and subsequent delivery by TEVs derived from 4T1 cells. We also produced Cy5-anti-miR-21-loaded TEVs from two other cancer cell lines (HepG2 and SKBR3) and confirmed their robust homologous and heterologous transfection efficiency and intracellular Cy5-anti-miR-21 delivery. Additionally, TEV-mediated anti-miR-21 delivery attenuated doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in breast cancer cells with a 3-fold higher cell kill efficiency than in cells treated with DOX alone. We then investigated TEVs as a biomimetic source for the functionalization of gold iron oxide nanoparticles (GIONs) and demonstrated nanotheranostic properties of TEV-GIONs in vitro. TEV-GIONs demonstrated excellent T2 contrast in in vitro magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and resulted in efficient photothermal effect in 4T1 cells. We also evaluated the biodistribution and theranostic property of anti-miR-21 loaded TEV-GIONs in vivo by labeling with indocyanine green near-infrared dye. We further validated the tumor specific accumulation of TEV-GIONs using MR imaging. Our findings demonstrate that the distribution pattern of the TEV-anti-miR-21-GIONs correlated well with the tumor-targeting capability as well as the activity and efficacy obtained in response to doxorubicin combination treatments. TEVs and TEV-GIONs are promising nanotheranostics for future applications in cancer molecular imaging and therapy.",,,,,,"SUKUMAR, UDAY KUMAR/0000-0002-0354-2353; Robinson, Elise/0000-0002-6527-901X; Massoud, Tarik/0000-0002-9694-1408; Paulmurugan, Ramasamy/0000-0001-7155-4738; Afjei, Rayhaneh/0000-0002-3762-3549; Habte, Frezghi/0000-0002-9488-3427; Pitteri, Sharon/0000-0002-3119-873X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,NOV,2018,12,11,,,,,10817,10832,,10.1021/acsnano.8b02587,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.8b02587,,,,,,,,30346694,,,,,WOS:000451789200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, we coated surface-carboxyl superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (US) with A33 antibodies (A33Ab-US), expecting that these A33 antibodies on the surface of the nanoparticles could bind to A33-positive exosomes and form a complex (A33Ab-US-Exo/Dox) to target A33-positive colon cancer cells. The results showed that A33Ab-US-Exo/ Dox had good binding affinity and antiproliferative effect in LIM1215 cells, as shown by increased uptake of the complex. In vivo study showed that A33Ab-US-Exo/ Dox had an excellent tumor targeting ability, and was able to inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of the mice with reduced cardiotoxicity.

Application of an external alternating magnetic field (AMF) generated heat above 42 degrees C and subsequent transition of the PLGA polymer matrix (T-g = 42-45 degrees C) from the glassy to the rubbery state, facilitating the controlled release of the loaded DOX, ultimately allowing for simultaneous hyperthermia and local heat-triggered chemotherapy for efficient dual cancer treatment.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved virotherapy for use in cancer treatment; however systemic administration remains as a particular challenge. Here we report exploitation of tumor lactate production in designing a hypoxia-responsive carrier, self-assembled from hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugated with 6-(2-nitroimidazole)hexylamine, for localized release of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2). The carrier is loaded with lactate oxidase (LOX) and is permeable to small molecules such as the lactate that accumulates in the tumor. Subsequently, LOX oxidizes the lactate to pyruvate inside the carrier, accompanied by internal lowering of oxygen partial pressure. Bioreduction of the 2-nitroimidazole of the HA conjugated with 6-(2-nitroimidazole)hexylamine converts it into a hydrophilic moiety and electrostatically dissociates the carrier and virus. Efficacious and specific delivery was proven by transduction of a photosensitive protein (KillerRed), enabling significant limitation in tumor growth in vivo with photodynamic therapy. An approximate 2.44-fold reduction in tumor weight was achieved after a 2-week course, compared with control groups. Furthermore, conjugation of the AAV2 with iron oxide nanoparticles (magnetized AAV2) facilitated magnetic resonance imaging tracking of the virus in vivo.

As an attempt to readily monitor the autophagy flux, we herein proposed an autophagy-responsive magnetic resonance imaging based on radical conjugated magnetic nanoparticles. In principle, both the NO center dot radical and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are stable, and separately contributing to an observation of enhanced T-1-and T-2-weighted imaging, respectively. Meanwhile, the onset of autophagy concomitantly simulates the mass production of reactive species, and consequently quenches the Ti-signal of NO center dot. On this basis, the content of autophagy flux is reflected by the ratio of Ti-signal intensity to that of T-2-signal, which is condition-insensitive, as a function of time. Assisted with such strategy, an unprecedented protection role autophagy played in respond to heat stress has been revealed, through which the killing effect of magneto-hyperthermia was greatly impeded. Furthermore, we noticed that the impairment of autophagy through the sequential chemotherapy, can markedly improve the therapeutic outcome, in a manner monitored and thoroughly analyzed using the strategy reported herein.

USMO@MSN could quickly dissolve under weakly acidic conditions and leach abundant Mn2+ ions (leaching ratio: 76%), enhancing the MR contrast. The longitudinal relaxation rate (r(1)) of USMO@MSNs significantly increased from 0.65 to 5.61 mM(-1) s(-1) as the pH decreased from 7.4 to 4.5, showing an ultrahigh-efficiency pH-switching T-1-weighted MR contrast ability for in vivo tumor. Meanwhile, the matching pore structure allowed effective loading of doxorubicin (DOX) on USMO@MSNs to form smart therapeutic system (USMO@MSNs-DOX). The DOX release rate was strongly proportional to the pH-switching MRI signal of USMO@MSNs-DOX, allowing the release of DOX to be efficiently monitored by MRI. Confocal observations indicated that USMO@MSNs-DOX could be effectively internalized by HSC3 cells, and the entire system showed a good pH-switching theranostic performance for HSC3 cells.

However, a safe BBB-traversing drug delivery system has brought new hope to glioma treatment. Exosomes have strong cargo-loading capacity and have the ability to cross the BBB. They can also be conferred with the ability for targeted delivery. Therefore, exosomes have great promise to be a targeted drug delivery vehicles. In this study, we firstly loaded superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and curcumin (Cur) into exosomes and then conjugated the exosome membrane with neuropilin-1-targeted peptide (RGERPPR, RGE) by click chemistry to obtain glioma-targeting exosomes with imaging and therapeutic functions. When administered to glioma cells and orthotopic glioma models, we found that these engineered exosomes could cross the BBB smoothly and provided good results for targeted imaging and therapy of glioma. Furthermore, SPION-mediated magnetic flow hyperthermia (MFH) and Cur-mediated therapy also showed a potent synergistic antitumor effect. Therefore, the diagnostic and therapeutic effects on glioma were significantly improved, while reducing the side effects. We have designed a new type of glioma-targeting exosomes, which can carry nanomaterials and chemical agents for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of glioma, thus providing a potential approach for improving the diagnosis and treatment effects of intracranial tumors.

The goals of this study are to develop an exosome platform that can target regions of tumor hypoxia and that can be monitored in vivo using magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Four types of exosomes (generated under hypoxic or normoxic conditions, and with or without exposure to X-ray radiation) were isolated from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Exosomes were labeled by DiO, a fluorescent lipophilic tracer, to quantify their uptake by hypoxic cancer cells. Subsequently, the exosomes were modified to carry SPIO (superparamagnetic iron oxide) nanoparticles and Olaparib (PARP inhibitor). FACS and fluorescence microscopy showed that hypoxic cells preferentially take up exosomes released by hypoxic cells, compared with other exosome formulations. In addition, the distribution of SPIO-labeled exosomes was successively imaged in vivo using MPI. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of Olaparib-loaded exosomes was demonstrated by increased apoptosis and slower tumor growth in vivo.

Hollow gold nanoshells (HAuNS, a photo thermal agent) and AUNP12 (an anti PD-1 peptide, APP) were co-encapsulated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. Unlike monoclonal PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, PD-1 peptide inhibitor shows lower cost and immunotoxicity but needs frequent administration due to its rapid clearance in vivo. Our data here showed that the formed HAuNS- and APP-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (AA@PN) could maintain release periods of up to 40 days for the peptide, and a single intratumoral injection of AA@PN could replace the frequent administration of free APP. After the administration of AARPN and irradiation with a near-infrared laser at the tumor site, an excellent killing effect on the primary tumor cells was achieved by the PTA. The nanoparticles also played a vaccine-like role under the adjuvant of cytosine-phospho-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotide and generated a localized antitumor-immune response. Furthermore, sustained APP release with laser-dependent transient triggering could induce the blockage of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway to activate T cells, thus subsequently generating a systemic immune response. Our data demonstrated that the PTA combined with perdurable PD-1 blocking could efficiently eradicate the primary tumors and inhibit the growth of metastatic tumors as well as their formation.

Herein, multistage stimuli-responsive nanovectors based on hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) were prepared to avoid delivery barriers for improved penetration and programmed tumor therapy. The versatile nanosystem was constructed through electrostatic complexation between the functional HMSNs loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and the small-sized platinum prodrug-conjugated poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM-Pt). The HMSNs were functionalized with dimethylmaleic anhydride tethered chitosan oligosaccharide to endow the particles of HMSN-CS(DMA) with charge-reversal properties. The as-prepared nanosystem had a stable structure of size approximate to 130 nm at pH 7.4, which is beneficial for blood circulation and tumor vessel extravasation of nanocarriers. Once it reaches the tumor site, the nanosystem can dissociate into HMSN@GEM-CS (approximate to 120 nm) and PAMAM-Pt dendrimer nanocarriers (approximate to 5 nm) in response to the acidic tumor microenvironment because of the acid-mediated charge-reversal, then the HMSN@GEM can play the antitumor role in surface tumor tissues. The dissociated PAMAM-Pt showed excellent performance in tumor penetration, cell uptake and intracellular trafficking due to the small size and positive charge, which was supported by the study of three-dimensional multicellular spheroids in vitro. Finally, the active cisplatin was released from the PAMAM-Pt dendrimer under the intracellular reducing environment to kill cells in deep tumor tissues. The significant tumor suppression of this system in vivo was validated in the A549 tumor xenografted mouse model.

The quality of the surface coating of nanoparticle-based MRI contrast agents, such as ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIONs), is critical to ensure high colloidal stability in biological environments, improved magnetic performance, and dispersion in circulatory fluids and tissues. Herein, we report the design of a library of 21 peptides and ligands and identify highly stable self-assembled monolayers on the USPIONs' surface. A total of 86 different peptide coated USPIONs are prepared and selected using several stringent criteria, such as stability against electrolyte-induced aggregation in physiological conditions, prevention of nonspecific binding to cells, and absence of cellular toxicity and contrast-enhanced in vivo MRI. The bisphosphorylated peptide 2PG-S*VVVT-PEG4-ol provides the highest biocompatibility and performance for USPIONs, with no detectable toxicity or adhesion to live cells.

High contrast enhancement of the liver is achieved as well as detection of liver tumors, with significant improvement of the contrast-to-noise ratio of tumor-to-liver contrast.

To confer protection while preserving their plasmonic properties, we allied the advantages of both materials and produced hybrid nanoparticles made of an anisotropic silver nanoplate core coated with a frame of gold. The efficiency of these hybrid nanoparticles (Ag@AuNPs) in photothermia was compared to monometallic silver nanoplates (AgNPs) or gold nanostars (AuNPs). The structural and functional properties of AuNPs, AgNPs, and Ag@AuNPs were investigated in environments of increasing complexity, in water suspensions, in cells, and in tumors in vivo. While AgNPs showed the greatest heating efficiency in suspension (followed by Ag@AuNPs and AuNPs), this trend was reversed intracellularly within a tissue-mimetic model. In this setup, AgNPs failed to provide consistent photothermal conversion over time, due to structural damage induced by the intracellular environment. Remarkably, the degraded Ag was found to be stored within the iron-storage ferritin protein. By contrast, the Au shell provided the Ag@AuNPs with total Ag biopersistence.

The mesenteric vein of tumor-bearing rats was catheterized, and TNPs were infused into the liver by accessing the portal vein for site-selective delivery. The uptake of TNPs with hepatic delivery was compared with systemic administration.

The currently approved therapeutic agents show a rather limited efficacy. We have recently demonstrated that the atypical cadherin FAT1 is a specific marker of CRC and that the FAT1-specific monoclonal antibody mAb198.3 may offer new therapeutic opportunities for CRC, being efficiently internalized by cancer cells and reducing cancer growth in colon cancer xenograft models. In this study we explored the therapeutic efficacy of mAb198.3 using two drug delivery systems (DDS) for improving the targeted treatment of CRC. The mAb198.3 was either directly bound to super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (spmNPs) or embedded into human erythrocyte-based magnetized carriers, named Erythro-MagnetoHemagglutinin Virosomes (EMHVs) to produce two different novel mAb198.3 formulations. Both DDS were endowed with magnetic properties and were anchored in the target tumor site by means of an external permanent magnet. The antibody loading efficiency of these two magnetically driven drug delivery systems and the overall therapeutic efficacy of these two formulations were assessed both in vitro and in a proof-of-concept in vivo study. We demonstrated that mAb198.3 bound to spmNPs or embedded into EMHVs was very effective in targeting FAT1-positive colon cancer cells in vitro and accumulating in the tumor mass in vivo. Although both in vivo administered mAb198.3 formulations have approximately 200 lower antibody doses needed, these showed to achieve a relevant therapeutic effect, thus reducing cancer growth more efficiently respect to the naked antibody. These results indicate that the two proposed magnetically driven drug delivery systems have a considerable potential as platforms to improve bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of anti-FAT mAb198.3 and raise new opportunities for a targeted therapy of CRC.",,,,,"Ricotti, Leonardo/GXF-0124-2022; Cinti, Caterina/HLX-2432-2023; Tombelli, Sara/H-6430-2013; Viale, Giuseppe/AAE-8921-2019; Giannetti, Ambra/Q-2681-2015; Baldini, Francesco/C-2210-2015; Renata, Grifantini/AAB-9969-2022; Pileri, Piero/N-6227-2016; Taranta, Monia/IUO-4735-2023; gherardini, lisa/HCI-2927-2022","Tombelli, Sara/0000-0003-1660-9833; Giannetti, Ambra/0000-0002-0002-2977; Baldini, Francesco/0000-0002-2689-5952; Renata, Grifantini/0000-0003-0024-3355; Pileri, Piero/0000-0002-2888-8748; Cinti, Caterina/0000-0001-8049-0369; gherardini, lisa/0000-0002-7003-4295; Ricotti, Leonardo/0000-0001-8797-3742; Grandi, Alberto/0000-0002-3496-0187",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-3659,1873-4995,,,,28-Jun,2018,280,,,,,,76,86,,10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.04.052,,,,,,,,29733876,,,,,WOS:000434382100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in view of their minute variations in concentration, short lifetimes, and limited ranges of action, in situ generation of ROS with specific manipulations should be more effective for ROS-responsive drug delivery. Here we present a new delivery nanoplatform for photodynamic therapy (PDT) with on-demand drug release regulated by light irradiation. Rose bengal (RB) molecules, which exhibit a high yield of ROS generation, were encapsulated in a mixture of chitosan (CTS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) with hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles through an oil-in-water emulsion method. The as-prepared magnetic nanoclusters (MNCs) with a tripolymer coating displayed high water dispersibility, efficient cellular uptake, and the cationic groups of CTS and bPEI were effective for RB loading through electrostatic interaction. The encapsulation efficiency of RB in MNCs could be further improved by increasing the amount of short bPEI chains. During the photodynamic process, controlled release of the host molecules (i.e., RB) or guest molecules (i.e., paclitaxel) from the bPEI-based nanoplatform was achieved simultaneously through a photooxidation action sensitized by RB. This approach promises specific payload release and highly effective PDT or PDT combined therapy in various cancer cell lines including breast (MCF-7 and multidrug resistant MCF-7 subline), SKOV-3 ovarian, and Tramp-CI prostate. In in vivo xenograft studies, the nanoengineered light-switchable carrier also greatly augments its PDT efficacy against multidrug resistant MCF-7/MDR tumor as compared with free drugs. All the above findings suggest that the substantial effects of enhanced drug distribution for efficient cancer therapy was achieved with this smart nanocarrier capable of on demand drug release and delivery, thus exerting its therapeutic activity to a greater extent.",,,,,,"del Valle, Andrea C./0000-0002-1698-9533; Huang, Yu-Fen/0000-0001-7686-8090",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,27-Jun,2018,10,25,,,,,21160,21172,,10.1021/acsami.8b05205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b05205,,,,,,,,29863836,,,,,WOS:000437811400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to on-demand remotely manipulate RNA and drug release in real time through single delivery system to sequentially play their respective roles for optimizing and enhancing their synergistic antitumor effects. To this end, a photoresponsive mesoporous silica nanoparticle (PMSN) is fabricated as a co-delivery vehicle of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) and photocaged prodrug of doxorubicin (DOX), by which the orthogonal and sequential release of shRNA and DOX can be achieved using an external light. In our design, the cationic poly[2-(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)- methacrylate] is introduced onto the PMSN surface through a light-sensitive coumarin ester derivative linker to adsorb P-gp shRNA, whereas the photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl ester derivative-caged DOX is loaded into the inner pores of the PMSN. The PMSN is found to be effectively internalized by MDR cancer cells, and the release of the shRNA and DOX is demonstrated to be independently regulated by 405 and 365 nm light irradiations due to selectively cleaved coumarin and o-nitrobenzyl ester, resulting in enhanced drug retention, and finally bring out optimized and significantly improved chemotherapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo for MDR cancer treatment, which might hold extensive application prospects in MDR cancer treatment in future.",,,,,"Li, jiong/IUQ-4771-2023","Zheng, Youshi/0000-0002-7939-2654; Tan, Xionghong/0000-0001-9113-4159; Lin, Xinyi/0000-0002-9075-5364; Zhao, Bixing/0000-0002-0055-3989; Wu, Ming/0000-0001-8326-4076; Zhang, Da/0000-0002-2613-1354",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,,,,,13-Jun,2018,10,23,,,,,19416,19427,,10.1021/acsami.8b03823,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b03823,,,,,,,,29771490,,,,,WOS:000435525100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

A strategy using a newly developed gold nanostar synthesis method, Raman reporter chemistry, and silication method to produce dual-modality contrast agents for combined surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging is devised. Following intravenous injection of the SERRS-MSOT-nanostars in brain tumor bearing mice, sequential MSOT imaging is performed in vivo and followed by Raman imaging. MSOT is able to accurately depict GBMs three-dimensionally with high specificity. The MSOT signal is found to correlate well with the SERRS images. Because SERRS enables uniquely sensitive high-resolution surface detection, it could represent an ideal complementary imaging modality to MSOT, which enables real-time, deep tissue imaging in 3D.

In particular, the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is used to solubilize small nanoclusters of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) without the use of any additional carrier materials. These nanoclusters are characterized with a high PpIX loading efficiency; a high loading capacity, stable behavior; high potency; and a synthetic approach that is amenable to large-scale production. In vivo studies of photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy show that the PpIX-coated SPION nanoclusters lead to a significant reduction in the growth rate of tumors in a syngeneic murine tumor model compared to both free PpIX and PpIX-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-polycaprolactone micelles, even when injected at 1/8th the dose. These results suggest that the nanoclusters developed in this work can be a promising nanotherapeutic for clinical translation.",,,,,"Busch, Theresa/J-5591-2019; Yan, Lesan/D-9276-2013; Tsourkas, Andrew/AAM-8252-2020","Yan, Lesan/0000-0003-3616-9628; Tsourkas, Andrew/0000-0001-7758-1753; Cheng, Zhiliang/0000-0003-3351-6874",,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-301X,1616-3028,,,,18-Apr,2018,28,16,,,,,,,1707030,10.1002/adfm.201707030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201707030,,,,,,,,29910700,,,,,WOS:000430163700024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we report a noninvasive thermally sensitive programmable therapetic system using bacteria E. coli MG1655 as an vehicle for tumor treatments via oral administration. Thermally sensitive programmable bacteria (TPB) are transformed with plasmids expressing therapeutic protein TNF-alpha and then decorated with biomineralized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to obtain TPB@Au. AuNPs and TNF-alpha plasmids efficaciously protected by TPB in the gut can be transported into internal microcirculation via transcytosis of microfold cells (M cells). After that, the bacteria-based antitumor vehicles accumulate at tumor sites due to the anaerobic bacterial feature of homing to tumor microenvironments. In vitro and in vivo experiments verify the successful delivery of AuNPs and TNF-alpha plasmids by TPB.

In vitro cellular uptake experiments demonstrated significantly higher nanoparticle uptake in PSMA-positive PC3pip cells than in PSMA-negative PC3flu cells. Further, more complete cell killing was observed in Pc3pip than in PC3flu cells upon exposure to light at different doses, demonstrating active targeting followed by Pc4 delivery. Likewise, in vivo studies showed remission on PSMA-expressing tumors 14 days post-PDT.

MPI is a noninvasive 3D tomographic imaging method with high sensitivity and contrast, zero ionizing radiation, and is linearly quantitative at any depth with no view limitations. The same superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIONs) tracers imaged in MPI can also be excited to generate heat for magnetic hyperthermia. In this study, we demonstrate a theranostic platform, with quantitative MPI image guidance for treatment planning and use of the MPI gradients for spatial localization of magnetic hyperthermia to arbitrarily selected regions. This addresses a key challenge of conventional magnetic hyperthermia SPIONs delivered systemically accumulate in off-target organs (e.g., liver and spleen), and difficulty in localizing hyperthermia results in collateral heat damage to these organs. Using a MPI magnetic hyperthermia workflow, we demonstrate image-guided spatial localization of hyperthermia to the tumor while minimizing collateral damage to the nearby liver (1-2 cm distance). Localization of thermal damage and therapy was validated with luciferase activity and histological assessment. Apart from localizing thermal therapy, the technique presented here can also be extended to localize actuation of drug release and other biomechanical-based therapies.

For effective PDT, nanoscale carriers are often needed to realize tumor-targeted delivery of photosensitizers, which ideally should further target specific cell organelles that are most vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Second, as oxygen is critical for PDT-induced cancer destruction, overcoming hypoxia existing in the majority of solid tumors is important for optimizing PDT efficacy. Furthermore, as PDT is a localized treatment method, achieving systemic antitumor therapeutic outcomes with PDT would have tremendous clinical values. Aiming at addressing the above challenges, we design a unique type of enzyme-encapsulated, photosensitizer-loaded hollow silica nanoparticles with rationally designed surface engineering as smart nanoreactors. Such nanoparticles with pH responsive surface coating show enhanced retention responding to the acidic tumor microenvironment and are able to further target mitochondria, the cellular organelle most sensitive to ROS. Meanwhile, decomposition of tumor endogenous H2O2 triggered by those nanoreactors would lead to greatly relieved tumor hypoxia, further favoring in vivo PDT.

Nevertheless, only a handful of proteins have been developed for biomimetic synthesis. Worse still, most of them are constrained on single-function usages in chemistry. Exploring new functional proteins, especially those with multi-dentate moieties for multi-role biomimetic chemistry, still remains a substantial challenge. Here, we report on a human endogenous protein, glutathione S-transferase (GST), with favorable amino acid motifs, that has innate talents in incubating high quality gold nano particles without adding reducing agents at physiological temperature, and particularly can further anchor gadolinium ions without adding extra chelators. The resultant paramagnetic AuNPs@GST(Gd) exhibits highly crystallization and uniform size of ca. 10 nm. Compared with clinical contrast agents (lopamidol, Magnevist), AuNPs@GST(Gd) shows better imaging performance (e.g. enhanced relaxivity and larger X-ray attenuation efficiency) with clear evidence from Monte Carlo simulation and in vitro experimental results. Further in vivo imaging demonstrates good tumor targeting and clearance of AuNPs@GST(Gd) without obvious systemic toxicity. Particularly, low immunogenicity of AuNPs@GST(Gd) is certified by immunological status evaluation of T cells after stimulated with them. This study for the first time demonstrates the manipulation of a human protein for multi-role biomimetic chemistry depending on its unique amino acid motifs and its incorporation into a synthetic agent for potentially addressing some critical issues in cancer nanotheranostics such as synthetic methodology, biocompatibility, function integration, targeting, and immunogenicity.

However, the potential of LDR Au NPs as an emerging strategy to treat cancer is strongly dependent on the macroscopic diffusion of the NPs in tumors, as well as on their microscopic internalization within the cells. Understanding the relationship between interstitial and intracellular distribution of NPs, and the outcomes of dose deposition in the cancer tissue is essential for considering future applications of radioactive Au NPs in oncology. Here, LDR Au NPs (Pd-103:Pd@Au-PEG NPs) were injected in prostate cancer tumors. The particles were visualized at time-points by computed tomography imaging (in vivo), transmission electron microscopy (ex vivo), and optical microscopy (ex vivo). These data were used in a Monte Carlo-based dosimetric model to reveal the dose deposition produced by LDR Au NPs both at tumoral and cellular scales.

Then, a peptide RLA ([RLARLAR](2)) with plasma membrane permeability and mitochondria-targeting capacity was anchored to AuNR@MSN via host-gust interaction. Subsequently, a charge-reversible polymer was introduced to endow stealth property. When the nanoplatform extravasates to tumor tissue, the weak acidity in tumor microenvironment could induce the dissociation of charge-reversible polymer and re-exposure of RLA peptide.

However, insufficient AC induction heating power at a biological safe range of AC magnetic field (H-appl.f(appl) < 3.0-5.0 x 10(9) A m(-1) s(-1)), and highly required biocompatibility of superparamagnetic nanoparticle (SPNP) hyperthermia agents are still remained as critical challenges for successful clinical hyperthermia applications.

We have recently shown that it is possible to exploit the protein corona for drug delivery by exploiting it for loading and triggering the release of a photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) for simultaneous photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) in vitro. Here, we extended our previous in vitro studies to evaluate its effectiveness in vivo. Specifically, we pre-formed the protein corona from mouse serum (MS) around gold nanorods (NRs) and loaded it with Ce6 to form NR-MS-Ce6. The intravenous delivery of NR-MS-Ce6 at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) Au loaded with 9.63 mu g kg(-1) Ce6 into tumor-bearing NCr nude mice resulted in their tumor accumulation reaching a peak concentration of 560.3 mu g Au per kg tissue (0.0752% dose) within 6 h post-injection. Subsequent localized laser irradiation of the xenograft tumor resulted in a significant tumor temperature increase of 16.85 degrees C within 20 min. Combined with the simultaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by Ce6 for PDT, complete tumor regression was achieved within 19 days with no tumor regrowth up to 31 days. Similar to other NPs, significant gold accumulation was observed in the major reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs, particularly the liver and spleen, although no acute toxicity was observed histologically 31 days post-treatment. Our results demonstrated for the first time an in vivo application of the protein corona around NPs in the loading and delivery of drugs in small animals.

Although nearly all of the nanomedicines approved in the clinical use can passively target to the tumor tissues on the basis of an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the nanodrugs have shown heterogenous responses in the patients. This phenomenon may be traced back to the EPR effect of tumor, which is extremely variable in the individuals from extensive studies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of experimental data describing the EPR effect and predicting its impact on therapeutic efficacy of nanoagents. Herein, we developed 32 nm magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MION) as a T-2-weighted contrast agent to describe the EPR effect of each tumor by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MION were synthesized by a thermal decomposition method and modified with DSPE-PEG2000 for biological applications. The PEGylated MION (Fe3O4@PEG) exhibited high r(2) of 571 mM(-1) s(-1) and saturation magnetization (M-s) of 94 emu g(-1) Fe as well as long stability and favorable biocompatibility through the in vitro studies. The enhancement intensities of the tumor tissue from the MR images were quantitatively measured as TNR (Tumor/Normal tissue signal Ratio) values, which were correlated with the delay of tumor growth after intravenous administration of the PLA-PEG/PTX micelle drug. The results demonstrated that the group with the smallest TNR values (TNR < 0.5) displayed the best tumor inhibitory effect. In addition, there was a superior correlation between TNR value and relative tumor delay in individual mice. These analysis results indicated that the TNR value of the tumor region enhanced by Fe3O4@PEG (d = 32 nm) could be used to predict the therapeutic efficacy of the micelle drugs (d <= 32 nm) in a certain period of time. Fe3O4@PEG has a potential to serve as an ideal MRI contrast agent to visualize the EPR effect in patients for accurate medication guidance of micelle drugs in the future treatment of tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,28-Jan,2018,10,4,,,,,1788,1797,,10.1039/c7nr08319j,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7nr08319j,,,,,,,,29308812,,,,,WOS:000423355300027,View Full Record in Web of Science

To date, few studies have investigated noninvasive molecular imaging for assessment of macrophage infiltration in response to therapy-induced apoptosis. Here, noninvasive assessment of changes in tumor accumulation of TAMs was proposed as a new way to measure early tumor response to anticancer therapy. Three different nanoparticles, QD710-Dendron quantum dots (QD710-D), Ferumoxytol, and PG-Gd-NIR813, were used for near-infrared fluorescence imaging, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and dual optical/T1-weighted MR imaging, respectively, in the MDA-MB-435 tumor model. Treatment with Abraxane induced tumor apoptosis and infiltrating macrophages. In spite of markedly different physicochemical properties among the nano particles, in vivo imaging revealed increased uptake of all three nanoparticles in Abraxane-treated tumors compared with untreated tumors. Moreover, imaging visualized increased uptake of QD710-D in MDA-MB-435 tumors but not in drug-resistant MDA-MB-435R tumors grown in the mice treated with Abraxane. Our results suggest that infiltration of macrophages due to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was partially responsible for increased nanoparticle uptake in treated tumors. Noninvasive imaging techniques in conjunction with systemic administration of imageable nanoparticles that are taken up by macrophages are a potentially useful tool for assessing early treatment response.

Herein, we introduce a versatile nanovaccine of liposomes-coated gold nanocages (Lipos-AuNC5) Modified with DCs specific antibody aCD11c for targeted delivery of adjuvant MPLA and melanoma antigen peptide TRP2 to promote the activation and maturation of DCs, and enhance tumor specific T lymphocytes responses. Moreover, AuNCs accumulation and AuNCs-engulfed DCs migration to regional lymph nodes (RLNs) became realtime visualization through in vivo fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging to monitor the immunity process. In vivo experimental results demonstrated that the targeted antigen/adjuvants-loaded AuNCs exhibited enhanced antitumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in both B16-F10 prophylactic and lung metastasis models, which may act as a promising nanoplatform for antitumor immunotherapy and in vivo tracking.

The crystalline nature and physicochemical features of the nanoparticles were identified by Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis.

Similarly, the NOAEL of AuNPs and Ag/AuNPs were calculated as 1000 mg per kg bw. Based on the in vivo studies, a significant tumour reduction (similar to 45 to 65%) was observed in the nanoparticle-treated animals, which was further confirmed by hematological, biochemical, TEM and histopathological analysis.

This contributes to tumor cell survival and their resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we exploited IL-4R targeted delivery of Bcl-xL siRNA to IL-4R-expressing tumor cells in order to sensitize them to chemotherapy. To target IL-4R, an IL-4R-binding peptide, IL4RPep-1, was attached to branched polyethyleneimine-superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (BPEI-SPION). These nanoparticles were then complexed with Bcl-xL-targeting siRNA. IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA more efficiently reduced Bcl-xL gene expression and enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MDA-MB231 breast tumor cells compared to untargeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA. The siRNA was released from the complexes after 15 h of incubation at pH 5.5 and was stable in the complexes up to 72 h in the serum. The IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/siRNA was internalized by cells through IL-4R, successfully escaped the endosomes, and was dispersed into the cytoplasm. Near-infrared fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that in vivo tumor homing and accumulation of IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/siRNA were both higher than untargeted BPEI-SPION/siRNA. The IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA, in combination with doxorubicin, significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice compared to untargeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA. These results suggest that the IL-4R-targeted delivery of Bcl-xL siRNA to IL-4R-expressing tumors can sensitize tumors to chemotherapy and enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutics.

Meanwhile, low dose of irradiation greatly potentiates the intratumoral angiogenesis, which promotes the local relapse and metastasis of tumor. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the irradiation dosage while inhibiting the tumor angiogenesis during radiotherapy. In this work, tumor vessel specific ultrafine Au@I nanoparticles (AIRA NPs) are fabricated and used as targeted radiosensitizers. Due to the presence of Au and iodine, these AIRA NPs exhibit superb X-ray attenuation for contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Once injected, these AIRA NPs bind specifically to both newly formed tumor vessels in peri- and intratumoral regions and pre-existing tumor vessels. Upon radiation under CT guidance, AIRA NPs remarkably enhanced the killing efficacy against tumors in vivo with respect to radiation alone or anti-angiogenesis chemotherapy. Meanwhile, down regulation of the level of circulating VEGF cytokine further indicates that our strategy can eradicate tumor without risking the recurrence of hypoxia and angiogenesis. Our demonstration provides a robust method of cancer therapy integrating good biocompatibility, high specificity and relapse-free manner alternative to traditional metal NPs enhanced radiotherapy.

The two booster effectors (dye-sensitization and core-shell enhancement) synergistically amplify the upconversion efficiency, therefore achieving superbright visible emission under low 808 nm light excitation. The markedly amplified red light subsequently triggers the photosensitizer (Ce6) to produce large amount of ROS for efficient PDT. After the silica is endowed with positive surface, these PDT nanoparticles can be easily grafted on MoS2 nanosheet. As the optimal laser wavelength of UCNPs is consistent with that of MoS2 nanosheet for PTT, the invented nanoplatform generates both abundant ROS and local hyperthermia upon a single 808 nm laser irradiation.

Tumor microenvironment modulation or advanced design of nanomedicine to achieve better therapeutic benefits for PDA treatment was widely advocated by many reviews. In the present study, a new photothermal therapy strategy of PDA was developed by combination of tumor microenvironment modulation and advanced design of biomimetic gold nanorods. On one hand, biomimetic gold nanorods were developed by coating gold nanorods (GNRs) with erythrocyte membrane (MGNRs). It was shown that MGNRs exhibited significantly higher colloidal stability in vitro, stronger photothermal therapeutic efficacy in vitro, and longer circulation in vivo than GNRs. On the other hand, tumor microenvironment modulation by cyclopamine treatment successfully disrupted the extracellular matrix of PDA and improved tumor blood perfusion. Moreover, cyclopamine treatment significantly increased the accumulation of MGNRs in tumors by 1.8-fold and therefore produced higher photothermal efficiency in vivo than the control group. Finally, cyclopamine treatment combined with photothermal MGNRs achieved the most significant shrinkage of Capan-2 tumor xenografts among all the treatment groups. Therefore, with the integrated advantages of tumor microenvironment regulation and long-circulation biomimetic MGNRs, effective photothermal therapy of PDA was achieved.

Various radiosensitizers, which can significantly enhance the radiotherapeutic performance, have been developed. Gold-based nanomaterials, as a new type of nanoparticle-based radiosensitizers, have been extensively used in researches involving cancer radiotherapy. However, the cancer therapeutic effect using the gold nanoparticle-based radiotherapy is usually not significant because of the low cellular uptake efficiency and the autophagy-inducing ability of these gold nanomaterials. Herein, using gold nanospikes (GNSs) as an example, we prepared a series of thiol-poly(ethylene glycol)-modified GNSs terminated with methoxyl (GNSs), amine (N1-12-GNSs), folic acid (FA) (FA-GNSs), and the cell-penetrating peptide TAT (TAT-GNSs), and evaluated their effects on X-ray radiotherapy. For the in vitro study, it was found that the ionizing radiation effects of these GNSs were well correlated with their cellular uptake amounts, with the same order of GNSs < NH2-GNSs < FA-GNSs < TAT-GNSs. The sensitization enhancement ratio (SER), which is commonly used to evaluate how effectively radiosensitizers decrease cell proliferation, reaches 2.30 for TAT-GNSs. The extremely high SER value for TAT-GNSs indicates the superior radiosensitization effect of this nanomaterial. The radiation enhancement mechanisms of these GNSs involved the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondria) depolarization, and cell cycle redistribution. Western blotting assays confirmed that the surface -modified GNSs could induce the up-regulation of autophagy-related protein (LC3-II) and apoptosis-related protein (active caspase-3) in cancer cells. By monitoring the degradation of the autophagy substrate p62 protein, GNSs caused impairment of autolysosome degradation capacity and autophagosome accumulation. Our data demonstrated that autophagy played a protective role against caner radiotherapy, and the inhibition of protective autophagy with inhibitors would result in the increase of cell apoptosis. Besides the above in vitro experiments, the in vivo tumor growth study also indicated that X-ray + TAT-GNSs treatment had the best tumor growth inhibitory effect, which confirmed the highest radiation sensitizing effect of TAT-GNSs.

Herein, we report a novel gold nanocluster-based platform for confocal laser endomicroscopy-guided photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) for PDAC, which consists of four components: the PTT-carrier gold nanocluster, an active targeting ligand U11 peptide, a Cathepsin E (CTSE)-sensitive PDT therapy prodrug, and a CTSE-sensitive imaging agent (cyanine dye Cy5.5). Due to the strong coupling among cross-linked gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the surface plasmon resonance peak of nanoclusters shifts to the near-infrared (NIR) region, thus making the nanoclusters useful in the effective PTT therapy. In the system, the labeling of nanoclusters with U11 peptide can distinctly increase their affinity and accelerate their uptake by pancreatic cancer cells. Cell apoptosis staining demonstrates that, upon incorporation of the uPAR-targeted unit, the antitumor efficacy of CTSE-sensitive nanocluster AuS-U11 is significantly enhanced with respect to that of the non-targeted nanocluster AuS-PEG and the insensitive nanocluster AuC-PEG. In vivo and ex vivo optical imaging confirms the high accumulation of AuS-U11 in the in situ pancreatic tumor model. Therapeutic studies further show that the combination of active targeting for tumor tissue, enzyme-triggered drug release of 5-ALA and fluorescent dye Cy5.5 in nanoclusters AuS-U11 could achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy with endomicroscopy-guided photothermal/photodynamic therapy with minimal side effects. As a consequence, the delicate gold nanocluster concept provides a promising strategy to enhance the therapy efficiency in the most challenging PDAC treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although caging strategy has recently been employed as an effective approach to conceal and stabilize these drugs to achieve light-activated cancer therapy, it is plagued by the sophisticated drug modification process and deleterious solvent usage. In addition, using UV or Visible light to remove photocaged group is restricted to its limited tissue penetration ability in and phototoxicity. In this paper, by anchoring photochromic spiropyran on the mesoporous silica coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP-SP), we design a NIR-controlled cage mimicking system.

Moreover, under NIR illumination, the UV/Visible emissions from UCNP can also efficaciously initiate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Curcumin, further improving the therapeutic efficiency.

For this purpose, an amine functional gold ion complex (GIC), [Au(III)(diethylenetriamine)Cl]Cl-2, which generates heat upon RF exposure, was conjugated to carboxyl-functional poly(acrylic acid)-capped iron-oxide nanoparticles (IO-PAA NPs) to form IO-GIC NPs of size similar to 100 nm. The multimodal super paramagnetic IO-GIC NPs produced T2-contrast on MR imaging and unlike IO-PAA NPs generated heat on RF exposure. The RF heating response of IO-GIC NPs was found to be dependent on the RF power, exposure period, and particle concentration. IO-GIC NPs at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL showed a high heating response (delta T) of similar to 40 degrees C when exposed to 100 W RF power for 1 min. In vitro cytotoxicity measurements on NIII-3T3 fibroblast cells and 4T1 cancer cells showed that IO-GIC NPs are cytocompatible at high NP concentrations for up to 72 h. Upon in vitro RF exposure (100 W, 1 min), a high thermal response leads to cell death of 4T1 cancer cells incubated with 1O-GIC NPs (1 mg/mL). Hematoxylin and eosin imaging of rat liver tissues injected with 100 mu L of 2.5 mg/mL IO-GIC NPs and exposed to low RF power of 20 W for 10 min showed significant loss of tissue morphology at the site of injection, as against RF-exposed or nanoparticle-injected controls. In vivo MR imaging and noninvasive RF exposure of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice after IO-GIC NP administration showed T2 contrast enhancement and a localized generation of high temperatures in tumors, leading to tumor tissue damage. Furthermore, the administration of IO-GIC NPs followed by RF exposure showed no adverse acute toxicity effects in vivo.

Nanotechnology-based combination therapy is a useful strategy. Recently, the combination of biologics and small drugs has attracted much attention in cancer therapy. Yet, the treatment outcomes are often compromised by the different pharmacokinetic profiles of the co-administered drugs thus leading to inconsistent drug uptake and suboptimal drug combination at the tumor sites. Nanotechnology-based co-delivery offers a promising method to address this problem, which is well demonstrated in the use of small drug combinations. However, co-delivery of the drugs bearing different physicochemical properties (e.g., proteins and small drugs) remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we developed a self-assembled nanosystem for co-delivery of trichosanthin (TCS) protein and albendazole (ABZ) as a combination therapy for overcoming MDR and metastasis. TCS is a ribosome-inactivating protein with high antitumor activity. However, the druggability of TCS is poor due to its short half-life, lack of tumor specific action, and low cell uptake. ABZ is a clinically used antihelmintic drug, which can also inhibit tubulin polymerization and thus serve as a potential antitumor drug. In our work, ABZ was encapsulated in the albumin-coated silver nanoparticles (termed ABZ@BSA/Ag NP). The thus-formed NPs were negatively charged and could tightly bind with the cationic TCS that was modified with a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) low-molecular-weight protamine (termed rTL). Via the stable charge interaction, the nanosystem (rTL/ABZ@BSA/Ag NP) was self-assembled, and featured by the TCS corona. The co-delivery system efficiently inhibited the proliferation of the drug-resistant tumor cells (A549/T and HCT8/ADR) by impairing the cytoskeleton, arresting the cell cycle, and enhancing apoptosis. In addition, the migration and invasion of tumor cells were inhibited presumably due to the impeded cytoskeleton functions. The anti-MDR effect was further confirmed by the in vivo studies with the subcutaneous A549/T tumor mouse model. More importantly, the co-delivery system was demonstrated to be able to inhibit metastasis. The co-delivery system of TCS/ABZ provided a potential strategy for both overcoming drug resistance and inhibiting tumor metastasis.",,,,,"Huang, Yongzhuo/A-4688-2013; Wang, Jigang/HJB-2711-2022","Huang, Yongzhuo/0000-0001-7067-8915; Wang, Jigang/0000-0002-0575-0105; Xu, Qin/0000-0002-2146-7342; Tang, Yisi/0000-0002-0894-6672",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,16-Aug,2017,9,32,,,,,26648,26664,,10.1021/acsami.7b05292,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b05292,,,,,,,,28741923,,,,,WOS:000408178400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

HMSNs with carboxyl groups to enhance the loadingd of DTIC, followed by further enveloping of folic acid-grafted liposomes, which act as a melanoma active target for controlled and targeted drug release. In vitro, DTIC@HMLBFs exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity to melanoma cells compared with DTIC@HMSNs and free DTIC. The in vivo investigations demonstrate that the rationally designed nanocarrier loaded with DTIC achieves significant improvement against lung metastasis of melanoma via targeting melanoma cells and tumor-associated' macrophages. This study provides a promising platform for the design and fabrication of multifunctional nanomedicines, which are potentially useful for the treatment of melanoma.",,,,,"liu, li/HGC-0900-2022; liu, qian/HDM-2936-2022; Zhang, Lianbin/C-1717-2012","Zhang, Lianbin/0000-0002-8548-1506",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,5-Jul,2017,9,26,,,,,21673,21687,,10.1021/acsami.7b05278,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b05278,,,,,,,,28590113,,,,,WOS:000405159100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The nanoparticles were fabricated using magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles as photothermal cores, thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-1-Vinyl-2-pyrrolidone p(NIPAM-co-NVP) as shells (Fe3O4-PNIPAM), with a hollow space between the two layers for loading of chemotherapeutic drug. The magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle cores could absorb and transform light to heat efficiently upon the irradiation of near infrared (NIR) laser, resulting in the shrink of the PNIPAM shell and the release of chemo-drugs. In vivo fluorescence/photoacoustic images demonstrated that Fe3O4-PNIPAM nanoparticles could accumulate in the tumor after intravenous injection. Upon the irradiation of the NIR laser, DOX-Fe3O4-PNIPAM nanoparticles exhibited outstanding synergistic effect.

However, clinical use of TRAIL is impeded by its short in vivo half-life and native TRIAL-resistant cancer cell populations. To overcome these limitations, we designed a multiple magnetic hyperthermia (MHT)-mediated TRAIL release system for combination therapy using an injectable, biodegradable and thermosensitive polymeric hydrogel. In this system, positively charged TRAIL and hydrophobic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are complexed with negatively charged poly(organophosphazene) polymers via ionic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy images showed a nano-sized core-shell structure of the TRAIL/SPION polymeric nanocomplex in aqueous solution that transformed into a hydrogel at body temperature. Hyperthermia can enhance the release of TRAIL from hydrogels through temperature-sensitive hydrogel dissolution. TRAIL-resistant U-87 MG cells were killed by the combination of TRAIL and multiple hyperthermia via caspase-3 and -8 active apoptosis. The hyperthermia-enhanced cytotoxicity of TRAIL was dependent on the hyperthermia cycle number and corresponding TRAIL release. Significant in vivo tumor reduction was observed by combining 2 cycles of mild MHT and TRAIL release using a single injection of TRAIL/SPION nanocomplex hydrogels without damage to main organs. Furthermore, the therapeutic outcomes can be monitored by long-term magnetic resonance imaging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The major hurdle of nanostructured therapeutic agents comes from the limited retention at the GBM site and poor selectivity. In this study, we reported dual-functional gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to figure out the biological barrier and improve their accumulation in GBM. The nanoparticles, AuNP-A&C-R, were composed of two functional particles: one was Ala-Ala-Asn-Cys-Asp (AK) and R8-RGD-comodified AuNPs (AuNP-AK-R) and the other was 2-cyano-6-amino-benzothiazole and R8-RGD-comodified AuNPs (AuNP-CABT-R). AuNP-A&C-R could aggregate in the presence of legumain, resulting in a size increase from 41.4 +/- 0.6 to 172.9 +/- 10.2 urn after 8 h incubation. After entering the circulatory system, AuNP-A&C-R actively targeted the integrin alpha(v)beta(3) receptor on blood brain barrier (BBB), mediated transcytosis of particles across BBB, and then targeted the receptor on the GBM cells. Once AuNP-A&C-R entered into GBM, they formed further aggregates with increased size extracellularly or intracellularly because of the overexpressed legumain, which in turn blocked their backflow to the bloodstream or limited their exocytosis by cells. In vivo optical imaging demonstrated that AuNP-A&C-R were efficiently delivered to the GBM site and retained with high selectivity. We further confirmed that AuNP-A&C-R acquired a higher accumulation at the GBM site than AuNP-A&C and AuNP-R because of the synergistic effect. More importantly, the doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded AuNP-A&C-R showed an improved chemotherapeutic effect to C6 GBM-bearing mice, which significantly prolonged the median survival time by 1.22-fold and 1.27-fold compared with the DOX-loaded AuNP-A&C and the DOX-loaded AuNP-R, respectively.

In this study, we developed an EGFRvIII-targeted nanoprobe to guide glioblastoma surgery by pre-operatively defining the tumor boundary via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operatively guiding resection by surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) imaging.

The porosity and size of the branches on this branched nanoporous gold nanoshell (BAuNSP) material can be facilely adjusted by control of the reaction speed or the reaction time between the redox-active polymer nanoparticles and gold ions (Au3+).

By taking advantage of the sharp branches and nanoporous features, BAuNSP exhibited greatly enhanced physico-optical properties, including photothermal effect, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and photo acoustic (PA) signals. The photothermal conversion efficiency can reach as high as 75.5%, which is greater than most gold nanocrystals. Furthermore, the nanoporous nature of the shells allows for effective drug loading and controlled drug release. The thermoresponsive polymer coated on the BAuNSP surface serves as a gate keeper, governing the drug release behavior through photothermal heating. Positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated a high passive tumor accumulation of Cu-64-labeled BAuNSP.

However, owing to the existence of blood-brain barrier (BBB), the tumor accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of clinical therapeutics is still of great concerns. To this end, we present herein a prominent therapeutic strategy adopting adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) capable of carrying nanotherapeutic payloads selectively toward brain tumors for thermo/chemotherapy. The nanoparticle (NP) payload was obtained from co-assembly of poly(gamma-glutamic acid-co-distearyl gamma-glutamate) with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), paclitaxel (PTX), and oleic acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs in aqueous solution. The particle size and drug loading content were ca 110 nm and 8.4 wt%, respectively. After being engulfed by ADSCs, the nanotherapeutics was found rather harmless to cellular hosts at a PTX concentration of 30 mu M over 48 h in the absence of pertinent stimulus. Nevertheless, the ADSC-based approach combined with high frequency magnetic field exhibits a sound therapeutic performance with a 4-fold increase in therapeutic index on brain astrocytoma (ALTS1C1)-bearing mice (C57BL/6 J) as compared to the typical chemotherapy using a current first-line chemodrug, temozolomide. Immunohistochemical examination of brain tumor sections confirms the successful cellular transport and pronounced cytotoxic action of therapeutics against tumor cells in vivo.

In the present report, the core concept of hypoxic NQO1-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) is based on the reasoning that the superior enzymatic activity of NQO1 within hypoxic cancer cells can be utilized as a key stimulus for the selective cleavage of an azobenzene stalk triggering the on-off gatekeeping for controlled release of guest drugs.

By combining enhanced extravasation and reduced intravasation, we achieved improved delivery and tumor retention of nanoparticles. Multiphoton imaging of mice bearing orthotopic tumors nanoparticles with different sizes showed that uIONPs exhibited more efficient extravasation out of tumor vessels and penetrated deeper into the tumor than larger sized IONP counterparts. Moreover, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging revealed that uIONPs exhibited bright T-1 contrast when dispersed in the tumor vasculature and peripheral area at 1 h after intravenous administration, followed by emerging dark T-2 contrast in the tumor after 24 h. Observed T-1-T-2 contrast switch indicated that uIONPs single-dispersed in blood with T1 contrast may self-assemble into larger clusters with T-2 contrast after entering the tumor interstitial space. Improved passive targeting and intratumoral delivery along with increased tumor retention of uIONPs are due to both easy extravasation into the tumor when single-dispersed and restricting intravasation back into circulation after forming clusters, thus exerting the enhanced permeability and retention effect for nanoparticle delivery to tumors.",,,,,"Xu, Yaolin/E-6957-2016; Li, yuancheng/IUO-3866-2023",", Jing/0000-0002-3117-0382",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,MAY,2017,11,5,,,,,4582,4592,,10.1021/acsnano.7b00038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b00038,,,,,,,,28426929,,,,,WOS:000402498400023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The magnetite silver hybrid NPs with core-shell (Fe3O4@Ag) or heteromer (Fe3O4-Ag) structures exhibited a higher biocompatibility with SMMC-7721 cells and L02 cells than the individual Ag NPs. Importantly, in the magnetic hyperthermia, with the exposure to alternating current magnetic field, the Fe3O4@Ag and Fe3O4-Ag hybrid NPs indicated much better tumor suppression effect against SMMC-7721 cells than the individual Fe3O4 NPs in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that the hybridisation of Fe304 and Ag NPs could greatly enhance the magnetic hyperthermia efficiency of Fe3O4 NPs. Therefore, the Fe3O4@Ag and Fe3O4Ag hybrid NPs can be used to be as high performance magnetic hyperthermia mediators based on a simple and effective preparation approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To test it, Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNs) and red blood cell membrane-derived vesicles (RBC-vesicles) are infused into a microfluidic device. When the mixture of MNs and RBC-vesicles flow through the electroporation zone, the electric pulses can effectively promote the entry of MNs into RBC-vesicles.

Owing to the superior magnetic and photothermal properties of the MN cores and the long blood circulation characteristic of the RBC membrane shells, core shell RBCMNs were used for enhanced tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Due to the completer cell membrane coating, RBC-MNs prepared by microfluidic electroporation strategy exhibit significantly better treatment effect than the one fabricated by conventional extrusion.

Under near-infrared light irradiation, CS-DOX-NCs produce the enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency through the maximized nonradiative transition of J-type Cypate aggregates, trigger the light-driven drug release through the destabilization of temperature-sensitive pi-pi interaction, and generate the effective intracellular translocation of doxorubicin from the lysosomes to cytoplasma through reactive oxygen species-mediated lysosomal disruption, thereby causing the potent in vivo hyperthermia and intracellular trafficking of drug into cytoplasma at tumors. Moreover, CS-DOX-NCs possess good resistance to photobleaching and preferable tumor accumulation, facilitating severe photoinduced cell damage, and subsequent synergy between photothermal and chemotherapeutic therapy with tumor ablation.

This system was fabricated by conjugating indocyanine green (ICG) on hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) using branched-polyethylenimine (PEI, MW = 10 kDa) as optimal linker, which provided a high ICG payload as well as a covering layer with suitable thickness on HAuNS to maintain ICG fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) productivity.

Compared with free ICG, ICG-PEI-HAuNS exhibited dramatically enhanced stability of ICG molecules and greater intratumoral accumulation. The conjugation of ICG caused significantly higher plasmon absorption of ICG-PEI-HAuNS in the NIR region compared with HAuNS alone, inducing remarkably enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency and synchronous photodynamic effect under NIR light irradiation.

HepG2 cells could be effectively bombed after 6 h co-incubation with AMLs. For in vivo applications, after preferentially targeting the tumor tissue when spatiotemporally navigated by an external magnetic field, the nanoscaled AMLs can intratumorally convert to microsized H2S bubbles. This dynamic process can be monitored by magnetic resonance and ultrasound dual modal imaging. Importantly, the intratumoral generated H2S bubbles imaged by real-time ultrasound imaging first can bomb to ablate the tumor tissue when exposed to higher acoustic intensity; then as gasotransmitters, intratumoral generated high-concentration H2S molecules can diffuse into the inner tumor regions to further have a synergetic antitumor effect. After 7-day follow-up observation, AMLs with magnetic field treatments have indicated extremely significantly higher inhibitions of tumor growth.

MVs inherit the membrane properties of their donor cells, which allows them to be modified with the biotin and FA on their own membrane. By conjugating with streptavidin-modified iron oxide nanoparticles (SA-IONPs), the MVs can be conveniently, efficiently, and rapidly isolated from the supernatant of their donor cells using magnetic activated sorting. Moreover, the conjugated magnetic nanoparticles and FA confer magnetic and ligand targeting activities on the MVs. Then, the MVs were transformed into antitumor delivery platforms by directly loading doxorubicin via electroporation. The modified MVs exhibited significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this study provides an efficient and convenient strategy for the simultaneous isolation of cell-derived MVs and transformation into targeted drug delivery nanovectors, thus facilitating the development of natural therapeutic nanoplatforms.",,,,,"sa, guoliang/V-6636-2018; Zhao, Yifang/A-5182-2015","sa, guoliang/0000-0002-4069-7231; Yu, Zi-Li/0000-0003-0728-8564; Chen, Gang/0000-0003-3332-3511",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,JAN,2017,11,1,,,,,277,290,,10.1021/acsnano.6b05630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b05630,,,,,,,,28005331,,,,,WOS:000392886500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

First is the monodispersed uPIC formation from the single molecules of therapeutic siRNA and the block catiomer, cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide-installed poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lysine) modified with lipoic acid (LA) at the.-end (cRGD-PEG-PLL-LA). Second is the surface decoration of a 20 nm-sized AuNP with uPICs. The cRGD-installed uPIC-AuNPs (cRGD-uPIC-AuNP) provided the targetability for selective binding to the cancer and cancer-related endothelial cellular surface, while regulating their size <50 nm with a quite narrow distribution. The targeting efficacy of the cRGD-uPIC-AuNP was confirmed by in vitro cellular uptake in cultured cervical cancer (HeLa) cells and in vivo tumor accumulation in a subcutaneous HeLa model after systemic administration, compared with a non-targeted control uPIC-AuNP. Due to the targetability of the ligand, the cRGD-uPIC-AuNP achieved the significantly enhanced gene silencing ability in the subcutaneous HeLa tumor. Ultimately, the systemic delivery of siRNA targeted for papilloma virus-derived E6 oncogene by cRGD-uPIC-AuNP significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous HeLa tumor.

By utilizing a class of ultrasmall metal NPs with the same size and surface chemistry but different densities, we found that the renal-clearance efficiency exponentially increased in the early elimination phase while passive tumor targeting linearly decreased with a decrease in particle density. Moreover, lower-density NPs are more easily distributed in the body and have shorter retention times in highly permeable organs than higher-density NPs.

Here, we demonstrate intravenous injectable stem-cell-membrane-camouflaged upconversion nanoarchitectures as a biomimetic tumor PDT platform. The biomimetic PDT system is constructed by fusing mesoporous-silica-encapsulated beta-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs with stem-cell membranes. Translocation of the stem-cell membranes to the UCNPs led to the translation of multiple membrane components, bringing the membranes' long circulation and tumor-targeting capability to the resulting platform. Multiphotosensitizers were encapsulated and simultaneously activated by a 980 nm single laser because of the multicolor emission capability of the UCNP cores. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that this novel platform inherits the tumor-targeting properties of stem cells and exhibits remarkable accumulation at the tumor site. In vivo tumor PDT results show higher tumor inhibition efficacy by tail intravenous administration of this new photosensitizer-loaded system.

We investigated different poly(methacrylic acid)-g-poly(ethyleneglycol methacrylate) polymers as in situ coating agents for magnetite nanocrystallites. The obtained magnetic nano-assemblies were in turn thoroughly characterized for their structural, colloidal and physicochemical properties (drug loading capacity/release, magnetic field triggered drug release, cell uptake and localization) in order to select the best performing system. With the focus on in vivo validation of such magnetic drug delivery systems for first time, we selected cisplatin as the drug, since it is a potent anticancer agent which exhibits serious side effects due to lack of selectivity. In addition, cisplatin would offer facile determination of the metal content in the animal tissues for biodistribution studies. Alongside postmortem Pt determination in the tissues, the biodistribution of the drug nanocarriers was also monitored in real time with PET-CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) with and without the presence of magnetic field gradients; using a novel chelator-free method, the nanoparticles were radiolabeled with Ga-68 without having to alter their structure with chemical modifications for conjugation of radiochelators. The ability to be radiolabeled in such a straightforward but very robust way, along with their measured high MRI response, renders them attractive for dual imaging, which is an important functionality for translational investigations. Their anticancer properties were evaluated in vitro and in vivo, in a cisplatin resistant HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma model, with and without the presence of magnetic field gradients. Enhanced anticancer efficacy and reduced toxicity was recorded for the cisplatin-loaded nanocarriers in comparison to the free cisplatin, particularly when a magnetic field gradient was applied at the tumor site. Post mortem and real-time tissue distribution studies did not reveal increased cisplatin concentration in the tumor site, suggesting that the enhanced anticancer efficacy of the cisplatin-loaded nanocarriers is driven by mechanisms other than increased cisplatin accumulation in the tumors.

Given the dual protection effect by the hyaluronan self-assembly as well as by the inorganic gold shell, verteporfin-encapsulated GNc-HyNA (Vp-GNc-HyNA) exhibited outstanding stability in the bloodstream. Interestingly, the fluorescence and photodynamic properties of Vp-GNc-HyNA were considerably quenched due to the gold nanoclusters covering the surface of the nanoassemblies; however, photothermal activation by 808 nm laser irradiation induced a significant increase in temperature, which empowered the PDT effect of Vp-GNc-HyNA. Furthermore, fluorescence and photodynamic effects were recovered far more rapidly in cancer cells due to certain intracellular enzymes, particularly hyaluronidases and glutathione. Vp-GNc-HyNA exerted a great potential to treat tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Tumors were completely ablated with a 100% survival rate and complete skin regeneration over the 50 days following Vp-GNc-HyNA treatment in an orthotopic breast tumor model. Our results suggest that photothermally boosted photodynamic therapy using Vp-GNc-HyNA can offer a potent therapeutic means to eradicate tumors.",,,,,"CHOI, KI YOUNG/Q-7177-2016; LEE, DOO SUNG/D-3363-2011; Park, Jae Hyung/B-5967-2018","CHOI, KI YOUNG/0000-0002-4207-2665; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,DEC,2016,10,12,,,,,10858,10868,,10.1021/acsnano.6b05113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b05113,,,,,,,,28024382,,,,,WOS:000391079700028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we demonstrate that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inhibit proliferation and migration of both PCCs and PSCs by disrupting the bidirectional communication via alteration of the cell secretome. Analyzing the key proteins identified from a functional network of AuNP-altered secretome in PCCs and PSCs, we demonstrate that AuNPs impair secretions of major hub node proteins in both cell types and transform activated PSCs toward a lipid-rich quiescent phenotype. By reducing activation of PSCs, AuNPs inhibit matrix deposition, enhance angiogenesis, and inhibit tumor growth in an orthotopic co-implantation model in vivo. Auto- and heteroregulations of secretory growth factors/cytokines are disrupted by AuNPs resulting in reprogramming of the TME. By utilizing a kinase dead mutant of IRE1-alpha, we demonstrate that AuNPs alter the cellular secretome through the ER-stress-regulated IRE1-dependent decay pathway (RIDD) and identify endostatin and matrix metalloproteinase 9 as putative RIDD targets.

This therapy is characterized by an improved PS accumulation in tumor regions. However, challenges, such as short penetration depth of light and low extinction coefficient of PSs, limit PDT applications. In this study, a nanocomposite consisting of NaYF4:Yb/Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCPs) conjugated with gold nanorods (Au NRs) was developed to improve the therapeutic efficiency of PDT. Methylene blue (MB) was embedded in a silica shell for plasmon-enhanced PDT. UCPs served as a light converter from near-infrared (NIR) to visible light to excite MB to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Au NRs could effectively enhance upconversion efficiency and ROS content through a localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Silica shell thickness was adjusted to investigate the optimized MB loading amount, ROS production capability, and efficient distance for plasmon-enhanced ROS production. The mechanism of plasmon-enhanced PDT was verified by enhancing UC luminescence intensity through the plasmonic field and by increasing the light-harvesting capability and absorption cross section of the system. This process improved the ROS generation by comparing the exchange of Au NRs to Au nanoparticles with different SPR bands. NIR-triggered nanocomposites of UCP@SiO2:MB-NRs were significantly confirmed by improving ROS generation and further Modifying folic acid (FA) to develop an active component targeting OECM-1 oral cancer cells. Consequently, UCP@SiO2:MB-NRs-FA could highly produce ROS and undergo efficient PDT in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of PDT treatment by UCP@SiO2:MB-NRs-FA was evaluated via the cell apoptosis pathway. The proposed process is a promising strategy to enhance ROS production through plasmonic field enhancement and thus achieve high PDT therapeutic efficacy.",,,,,"Chan, yung-chieh/E-4091-2012; Liu, Ru-Shi/A-6796-2010; Hsiao, Michael/U-6238-2019","Liu, Ru-Shi/0000-0002-1291-9052; Hsiao, Michael/0000-0001-8529-9213",,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-8244,1944-8252,,,,30-Nov,2016,8,47,,,,,32108,32119,,10.1021/acsami.6b07770,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b07770,,,,,,,,27933825,,,,,WOS:000389161600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Magnetic targeting has shown to further enhance tumor accumulation in response to a magnetic field gradient. It is widely known that passive accumulation of nanocarriers varies hugely in tumor tissues of different tumor vascularization. It is hypothesized that magnetic targeting is likely to be influenced by such factors. In this work, magnetic targeting is assessed in a range of subcutaneously implanted murine tumors, namely, colon (CT26), breast (4T1), lung (Lewis lung carcinoma) cancer and melanoma (B16F10). Passively- and magnetically-driven tumor accumulation of the radiolabeled polymeric magnetic nanocapsules are assessed with gamma counting. The influence of tumor vasculature, namely, the tumor microvessel density, permeability and diameter on passive and magnetic tumor targeting is assessed with the aid of the retrospective design of experiment (DoE) approach. It is clear that the three tumor vascular parameters contribute greatly to both passive and magnetically targeted tumor accumulation but play different roles when nanocarriers are targeted to the tumor with different strategies. It is concluded that tumor permeability is a rate-limiting factor in both targeting modes. Diameter and microvessel density influence passive and magnetic tumor targeting, respectively.

AuNPs-AK could be hydrolyzed to expose the 1,2-thiolamino groups on AuNPs-AK in the presence of legumain, which occurs by a click cycloaddition with the contiguous cyano group on AuNPs-CABT, resulting in formation of AuNPs aggregates.

By taking advantage of hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) that can intrinsically radiolabel an oxophilic zirconium-89 (Zr-89, t(1/2) = 78.4 h) radionuclide, as well as possess great drug loading capacity, Ce6 can be activated by Cerenkov radiation from Zr-89 in the same nanoconstruct.

Curcumin (Cur), a natural product,. exerts promising anticancer activities against various cancer types. However, its therapeutic efficacy is hindered as a result of poor water solubility, instability, and low bioavailability. The aim of this work is to assess the curative effect of a novel nanoformulation, i.e., Cur-loaded and calcium-doped dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles modified with folic acid (Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA) for breast cancer therapy. The results manifested that Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA dispersed very well in aqueous solution, released Cur with a pH-responsible profile, and targeted efficiently to human breast cancer MU-7 cells.. Further investigations indicated that Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA effectively inhibited cell proliferation, increased intracellular ROS generation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhanced cell cycle retardation at G2/M phase, leading to a higher apoptosis rate in MCF-7 compared to free Cur. Moreover, the Western blotting analysis demonstrated that Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA were more active than free Cur through suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. In addition, hemolysis, assay showed that the Ca@DMSNs-FA exhibited good biocompatibility. Last, in vivo studies indicated that when Cur was encapsulated in Ca@DMSNs-FA, the Cur concentration in blood serum and tumor tissues was increased after 1 h intraperitoneal injection.

We discovered that the DB could be tuned facilely by simply adjusting synthetic parameters, such as the solvent type, the type and concentration of the long chain amines. We found that DB tuning resulted in dramatic tunability in the optical properties in the near infrared (NIR) range, which led to significantly different performance in the photothermal cancer therapy. Our in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that AuNDs with a higher DB were more efficient in photothermal tumor destruction under a lower wavelength NIR irradiation. In contrast, those with a lower DB performed better in tumor destruction under a higher wavelength NIR irradiation, indicating that AuNDs of even lower DB should have even better photothermal cancer therapy efficiency within the second NIR window.

Therefore, new diagnostic tools that capture the molecular activity at the disease site in vivo are needed to better understand tumor behavior and ultimately maximize therapeutic responses. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) drive multiple aspects of tumorigenesis, and their activity can be monitored using engineered peptide substrates as protease-specific probes. To identify tumor specific activity profiles, local sampling of the tumor microenvironment is necessary, such as through remote control of probes, which are only activated at the tumor site. Alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) provide an attractive option to remotely apply local triggering signals because they penetrate deep into the body and are not likely to interfere with biological processes due to the weak magnetic properties of tissue. Here, we report the design and evaluation of a protease activity nanosensor that can be remotely activated at the site of disease via an AMF at 515 kHz and 15 kA/m.

However, most solid tumors, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), do not have identifiable surface markers to distinguish themselves from normal cells, thus it is challenging to selectively identify and eliminate those malignances by PTT. In this report, we hypothesized that, by targeting CD44 (one TNBC-overexpressed surface molecule) and depleting heat shock protein 72 (HSP72, one malignancy-specific-overexpressed thermotolerance-related chaperone) subsequently, the TNBC could be selectively sensitized to PTT and improve the accuracy of treatment. To this end, a rationally designed nanosystem gold nanostar (GNS)/siRNA against HSP72 (siHSP72)/hyaluronic acid (HA) was successfully constructed using a layer-by-layer method. Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential analysis demonstrated the formation of GNS/siHSP72/HA having a particle size of 73.2 +/- 3.8 nm and a negative surface charge of 18.3 +/- 1.6 mV. The CD44-targeting ability of GNS/siHSP72/HA was confirmed by the flow cytometer, confocal microscopic imaging, and competitive binding analysis. The HSP72 silencing efficacy of GNS/siHSP72/HA was similar to 95% in complete culture medium. By targeting CD44 and depleting HSP72 sequentially, GNS/siHSP72/HA could selectively sensitize TNBC cells to hyperthermia and enhance the therapeutic efficacy to TNBC with minimal side effect both in vitro and in vivo. Other advantages of GNS/siHSP72/HA included easy synthesis, robust siRNA loading capacity, endosome/lysosome escaping ability, high photothermal conversion efficacy and superior hemo- and biocompatibility.",,,,,"Wang, Shouju/AEG-1733-2022","Wang, Shouju/0000-0001-9213-6818; Tian, Ying/0000-0002-6031-2335",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,SEP,2016,10,9,,,,,8578,8590,,10.1021/acsnano.6b03874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.6b03874,,,,,,,,27576159,,,,,WOS:000384399300051,View Full Record in Web of Science

Manganese extraction sensitive to tumor microenvironment was enabled in manganese-doped hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (designated as Mn-HMSNs) to fast promote the disintegration and biodegradation of Mn-HMSNs, further accelerating the breakage of Si O Si bonds within the framework.

Additionally, a hybridized Mucin-1 aptamer is conjugated on the surface of the test liposomes, which then function as a recognition probe to enhance the uptake of those liposomes by cells, and as a molecular beacon to signal when the internalized particles have been maximized, which is the optimal time for photothermally triggering the release of the drug following the systemic administration of the liposomes. Empirical results reveal that this combined treatment effectively controls targeted drug release in a spatially and temporally precise fashion and so significantly increases the potency of the drug while minimizing unwanted side effects, making it a promising treatment for cancer.

In this study we designed and synthesized magnetically and pH dual responsive dendrosomes with magnetic nanoparticles and folate-targeted dendrimers encapsulated in long-circulating pH sensitive liposomes. Cellular uptake and tissue penetration were assessed on cell lines and tumor spheroids respectively. Xenograft mice were used to study tumor accumulation. The dendrosomes were stable at pH 7.4, but responsively released their content at acidic pH. In slightly acid environments, the hybrid vectors showed similar cytotoxicity and cellular uptake to the free folate-dendrimers conjugate due to rapid release. The dendrosomes showed a greater cellular uptake by HeLa cells ( FA receptor positive) due to the conjugation with folic acid ( FA). In multicellular tumor spheroid tests, a slightly acidic environment and the application of magnet both promoted the permeation efficiency of the hybrid vectors. In the xenograft mice model both in vivo images and tissue distribution assessment indicated that the dendrosomes had higher peak intensity and a longer residence time. Through the synergistic effects of magnetic responsiveness and both passive and active targeting properties, the multi-functional dendrosomes were demonstrated to have great potential as a promising anticancer drug delivery platform.

The purpose of the study was to develop a tumor-targeted theranostic nanovehicle for pancreatic cancer detectable by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). To improve the tumor specificity of our mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN), we utilized a dual targeting strategy: 1) an elevated tumor receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (UPAR), and 2) the acidic tumor microenvironment. The tumor specificity of the MSN particle was improved with the addition of both chitosan, targeting acidic pH, and urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA), targeting UPAR. Drug release assays confirmed pH responsive release of gemcitabine in vitro. The UPAR specific binding of MSN-UPA nanoparticles was confirmed by reduction in fluorescence signal following MSN-UPA nanoparticle treatment in UPAR positive cells blocked with a UPAR-blocking antibody. Based upon Indocyanine Green encapsulation within the nanoparticles, UPA ligand targeted MSNs demonstrated increased intensity compared to untargeted MSNs at both pH 7.4 (7x) and 6.5 (20x); however the signal was much more pronounced at a pH of 6.5 using tissue phantoms (p < 0.05). In vivo, MSN-UPA particles demonstrated orthotopic pancreatic tumor specific accumulation compared to liver or kidney as identified using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (p < 0.05) and confirmed by ex vivo analysis. By tracking in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution with MSOT, it was shown that pH responsive, ligand targeted MSNs preferentially bind to pancreatic tumors for payload delivery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The real-time monitoring of selenol is of scientific interest for understanding the anticancer mechanism of Na2SeO3 Based on selenol's ability to specifically break Au-S bonds and form more stable Au Se bonds on the surfaces of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), we developed a novel near-infrared fluorescent nanosensor (Cy5.5-peptide-AuNPs) for detecting selenol. The nanosensor exhibited rapid response to selenol with high selectivity and sensitivity, and it was successfully used to image changes in the selenol level in HepG2 cells during Na2SeO3-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in vivo fluorescence imaging of selenol was obtained from H22 tumor-bearing mice injected with both the nanosensor and sodium selenite. The results showed that the tumor cell apoptosis induced by Na2SeO3 is correlated with high-level of selenol under hypoxic conditions. We believe that this nanosensor could serve as a powerful tool for monitoring selenol and exploring the physiological function of selenol in a variety of physiological and pathological contexts and that the probe-designed strategy will provide a new platform for research on relevant selenium chemistry.

The first drug, gemcitabine (GEM, 40wt%), was loaded in positively-charged ammonium-functionalized MSN (MSN-NH3+).

To translate this synergistic therapy into in vivo anticancer therapy and clinical practice, we designed a novel pH-sensitive charge conversion nanocarrier (M-HHG(2)C(18)-L) that contained erlotinib/DOX combination and produced a sequential staggered drug release for synergistic lung cancer therapy. In this study, a synthetic zwitterionic oligopeptide lipid (1,5-dioctadecyl-L-glutamyl2-histidyl-hexahydrobenzoic acid, HHG(2)C(18)) was used to construct a pH-sensitive lipid bilayer (HHG(2)C(18)-L), which was subsequently applied to coat amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2). Erlotinib and DOX were separately incorporated into HHG(2)C(18)-L and MSN-NH2 respectively to obtain pH-sensitive charge conversion erlotinib/DOX co-delivery nanoparticles (M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D)). We confirmed that M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D) were able to reverse surface zeta potential from negative to positive at tumor extracellular pH, thus facilitating the targeted cancer cell internalization. Furthermore, as erlotinib was sequestered in the exterior lipid bilayer and the controlled release ability of MSN-NH2, erlotinib released faster than DOX during the cellular transport. Additionally, HHG(2)C(18)-L became more positive at tumor intracellular pH and enhanced Coulombic repulsion with MSN-NH2, leading to increased sequential staggered release of erlotinib and DOX. Due to the pretreatment and time-staggered inhibition of EGFR with erlotinib and the enhanced intracellular release of DOX to the nucleus, the maximized synergistic cell killing effect was achieved. Compared to non-sensitive erlotinib/DOX co-delivery nanoparticles (M-SPC-L(E + D)) and simultaneous DRUG coadministration. M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D) with sequential staggered drug release and pH-sensitive charge conversional properties showed great synergistic effects in antiproliferation and apoptosis of A549 human cancer cells in vitro.

Competitive binding experiments were performed in vivo by injecting free FMN in excess. Bio-distribution of FLUSPIO was determined by estimating iron content in organs and tumors using a colorimetric assay.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry data confirmed FMN present on the USPIO nanoparticle surface. FLUSPIO uptake in prostate cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was significantly higher than that of control USPIO, while addition of excess of free FMN reduced accumulation. Similarly, in vivo MRI and histology showed specific FLUSPIO uptake by prostate cancer cells, tumor endothelial cells, and tumor-associated macrophages.

In this study, we synthesized SM5-1-conjugated gold nanoparticles (Au-SM5-1 NPs) and investigated their anticancer efficacy in HCC both in vitro and in vivo. The tumor inhibition rates of Au-SM5-1 NPs for subcutaneous tumor mice were 40.10% +/- 4.34%, 31.37% +/- 5.12%, and 30.63% +/- 4.87% on day 12, 18, and 24 post-treatment as determined by bioluminescent intensity. In addition, we investigated the antitumor efficacy of Au-SM5-1 NPs in orthotopic HCC tumor models. The results showed that the inhibition rates of Au-SM5-1 NPs can reach up to 39.64% +/- 4.87% on day 31 post-treatment determined by the bioluminescent intensity of the abdomen in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, three-dimensional reconstruction results of the orthotopic tumor revealed that Au-SM5-1 NPs significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with SM5-1 alone. Our results suggested that the developed Au-SM5-1 NPs has great potential as an antibody based nano-drug for HCC therapy. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

They are constructed by the fusion of biocompatible AuNSs and MPCM vesicles. The resulting MPCM-coated AuNSs exhibited good colloidal stability and kept the original near-infrared (NIR) adsorption of AuNSs. Because AuNS carried high density coverage of MPCMs, the totally functional portions of macrophage cells membrane were grafted onto the surface of AuNSs. This surface functionalization provided active targeting ability by recognizing tumor endothelium and thus improved tumoritropic accumulation compared to the red blood cell membrane coating approach.

In the present work, we proposed a multifunctional theranostic micellar drug delivery system utilizing cationic PDMA-block-poly(s-caprolactone) (PDMA-b-PCL) micelles as nanocarriers of SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO), and small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The VEGF siRNA was conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) (siRNA-PEG) before complexation with the micelles in order to improve the siRNA's stability and to prolong its retention time in the blood circulation. To further improve the in vivo biosafety, we prepared mixed micelles using mPEG-PCL together with PDMA-b-PCL copolymer. The SN-38/USPIO-loaded siRNA-PEG mixed micelleplexes passively targeted to tumor regions and synergistically facilitated VEGF silencing and chemotherapy, thus efficiently suppressing tumor growth via a multi-dose therapy regimen. Additionally, the SN-38/USPIO-loaded siRNA-PEG mixed micelleplexes acted as a negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent in T2-weighted imaging, resulting in a powerful tool for the diagnosis and for tracking of the therapeutic outcomes. In summary, we established a theranostic micellar drug and gene delivery system that not only synergistically combined gene silencing and chemotherapy but also served as a negative MRI contrast agent, which reveal its potential as a novel colorectal cancer therapy.

The release of drug from the RH intercalated LDHs was made very fast or sustained by altering the exchangeable anions followed by the modified Freundlich and parabolic diffusion models.

We further explore every key aspect of this magnetophotothermal approach, choosing iron oxide nanocubes for their high efficiency for the magnetic hyperthermia modality itself. In aqueous suspension, the nanocubes' exposure to both: an alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation (808 nm), defined as the DUAL-mode, amplifies the heating effect 2- to 5-fold by comparison with magnetic stimulation alone, yielding unprecedented heating powers (specific loss powers) up to 5000 W/g. In cancer cells, the laser excitation restores the optimal efficiency of magnetic hyperthermia, otherwise inhibited by intracellular confinement, resulting in a remarkable heating efficiency in the DUAL-mode (up to 15-fold amplification), with respect to the magnetophotothermal mode. As a consequence, the dual action yielded complete apoptosis-mediated cell death. In solid tumors in vivo, single-mode treatments (magnetic or laser hyperthermia) reduced tumor growth, while DUAL-mode treatment resulted in complete tumor regression, mediated by heat-induced tumoral cell apoptosis and massive denaturation of the collagen fibers, and a long-lasting thermal efficiency over repeated treatments.",,,,,"Pellegrino, teresa/G-6417-2010; Espinosa, Ana/G-9162-2011; Di Corato, Riccardo/C-3606-2008; Kolosnjaj-Tabi, Jelena/HJA-4917-2022","Espinosa, Ana/0000-0002-5626-6129; Di Corato, Riccardo/0000-0002-7173-6176; Pellegrino, Teresa/0000-0001-5518-1134; Wilhelm, Claire/0000-0001-7024-9627; Kolosnjaj-Tabi, Jelena/0000-0002-0144-9622",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,FEB,2016,10,2,,,,,2436,2446,,10.1021/acsnano.5b07249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5b07249,,,,,,,,26766814,,,,,WOS:000370987400085,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, major challenges facing their application in this regard are further enhancement of tumor accumulation of the particles in addition to enhanced permeability retention (EPR) effect and an understanding of the optimal particle size and time for applying radiotherapy after the particle administration. In this study, we fabricated novel cyclic c(RGDyC)-peptide-conjugated, Gd- and 99 mTc-labeled AuNPs (RGD@AuNPs-Gd99 mTc) probes with different sizes (29, 51, and 80 nm) and evaluated their potential as radiosensitization therapy both in vitro and in vivo. We found that these probes have a high specificity for alpha nu beta 3 integrin positive cells, which resulted in their high cellular uptake and thereby enhanced radiosensitization. Imaging in vivo with MRI and SPECT/CT directly showed that the RGD@AuNPs-Gd99 mTc probes specifically target tumors and exhibit greater accumulation within tumors than the RAD@AuNPsGd99 mTc probes. Interestingly, we found that the 80 nm RGD@AuNPs-Gd99 mTc probes exhibit the greatest effects in vitro; however, the 29 nm RGD@AuNPs-Gd99 mTc probes were clearly most efficient in vivo. As a result, radiotherapy of tumors with the 29 nm probe was the most potent.

An attractive approach is to build the vaccine upon a biocompatible NP that simultaneously acts as accurate delivery vehicle and radiotracer for PET/SPECT imaging for ultrasensitive and quantitative in vivo imaging of NP delivery to target tissues/organs. Success in developing these nanovaccines will depend in part on having a correct NP size and accommodating and suitably displaying antigen and/or adjuvants (e.g., TLR agonists). Here we develop and evaluate a NP vaccine based on iron oxide-selective radio-gallium labeling suitable for SPECT(Ga-67)/PET(Ga-68) imaging 2 Targeted image-tracked nanovaccines and efficient delivery of antigen (OVA) and TLR 9 agonists (CpGs) using lipid-coated magnetite micelles. OVA, CpGs and rhodamine are easily accommodated in the hybrid micelles, and the average size of the construct can be controlled to be ca. 40 mu in diameter to target direct lymphatic delivery of the vaccine cargo to antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the lymph nodes (LNs). While the OVA/CpG-loaded construct showed effective delivery to endosomal TLR 9 in APCs, SPECT imaging demonstrated migration from the injection site to regional and nonregional LNs. In correlation with the imaging results, a range of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that by using this microdosed nanosystem the cellular and humoral immune responses are greatly enhanced and provide protection against tumor challenge.

For practical applications, it is essential for such nanomedicine to possess robust stability and minimal premature release of therapeutic molecules during circulation in the blood stream. To meet this requirement, herein, we develop GSH-responsive and crosslinkable amphiphilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to modify carrier-free drug NPs. These PEG molecules can be cross-linked on the surface of the NPs to endow them with greater stability and the cross-link is sensitive to intracellular environment for bio-responsive drug release. With this elegant design, our experimental results show that the liberation of DOX from DOX-cross-linked PEG NPs is dramatically slower than that from DOX-non-cross-linked PEG NPs, and the DOX release profile can be controlled by tuning the concentration of the reducing agent to break the cross-link between PEG molecules. More importantly, in vivo studies reveal that the DOX-cross-linked PEG NPs exhibit favorable blood circulation half-life (> 4 h) and intense accumulation in tumor areas, enabling effective anti-cancer therapy.

When compared to the same dose of VCR-loaded isotropic nano-assemblies (SINs), the decrease in the leukocytes count and the positive expression ratio of CD13 in the VCR-SANs group were 19.38% and 16.4%, respectively, which indicated the improved anti-leukemia activity of the VCR-SANs. From the results of the pharmacokinetics study, the VCR-SANs remarkably held the amount of drug removed from the whole body per unit time half of the isotropic group and the concentration of drug in blood plasma against time was 2.1 times the isotropic group, demonstrating the rapid and sustained release behavior and longer blood circulation when combined with the results of in vivo tissue distribution studies. In summary, anisotropic nano-assemblies were found to be more promising than isotropic nano-assemblies via our in vivo and in vitro examinations.",,,,,"Tian, Jilai/X-1727-2019","Tian, Jilai/0000-0002-5695-9881; Hu, ke/0000-0001-7501-0420",,,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,,2016,8,39,,,,,17085,17089,,10.1039/c6nr05781k,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6nr05781k,,,,,,,,27714144,,,,,WOS:000386074900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we have proposed a multifunctional nanoparticle that integrate magnetic targeting, drug-carrier functionality and real-time MRI imaging capabilities in one platform for the theranostic treatment of tumors. The multifunctional nanoparticle was designed with a superparamagnetic iron oxide core and a multifunctional shell composed of PEG/PEI/polysorbate 80 (Ps 80) and was used to encapsulate DOX. DOX-loaded multifunctional nanoparticles (DOX@Ps 80-SPIONs) with a D-h of 58.0 nm, a zeta potential of 28.0 mV, and a drug loading content of 29.3% presented superior superparamagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization (Ms) of 24.1 emu g(-1). The cellular uptake of DOX@Ps 80-SPIONs by C6 cells under a magnetic field was significantly enhanced over that of free DOX in solution, resulting in stronger in vitro cytotoxicity. The real-time therapeutic outcome of DOX@Ps 80-SPIONs was easily monitored by MRI. Furthermore, the negative contrast enhancement effect of the nanoparticles was confirmed in glioma-bearing rats. Prussian blue staining and ex vivo DOX fluorescence assays showed that the magnetic Ps 80-SPIONs and encapsulated DOX were delivered to gliomas by imposing external magnetic fields, indicating effective magnetic targeting. Due to magnetic targeting and Ps 80-mediated endocytosis, DOX@Ps 80-SPIONs in the presence of a magnetic field led to the complete suppression of glioma growth in vivo at 28 days after treatment. The therapeutic mechanism of DOX@Ps 80-SPIONs acted by inducing apoptosis through the caspase-3 pathway. Finally, DOX@Ps 80-SPIONs' safety at therapeutic dosage was verified using pathological HE assays of the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence imaging detected the azide and alkyne groups on DOX/azide@AuNP and Alkyne-MMP@Qdot, respectively, and the click-reactivity was also confirmed. In the presence of the catalyst, two nanoparticles were clicked to doxorubicin nanoclusters, which increased the volume of the particles ca. 343-fold within 30 min. Upon matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) digestion, the nanoclusters were clearly dissociated into smaller particles, and the fluorescence of the quenched Qdot was also recovered, which suggests that the nanoclusters respond to MMP-2 concentrations and can thus be employed for cancer imaging. Confocal microscopy and an elemental analysis of the cancer cells revealed that the cellular uptakes of doxorubicin nanoclusters significantly increased at higher MMP-2 concentrations, and doxorubicin could also be cleaved for anti-cancer effects. In vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity assay accordingly showed that the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin nanoclusters against cancer cells increased in MMP-2-rich environments such as tumor site.

Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have been regarded as remarkable PA contrast agents because of their low toxicity and biodegradable properties. However, IONP delivery is restricted by its modest leakage and retention in tumors. In this study, we designed IONPs (20 nm, 50 nm, and 100 nm) conjugated with anti-HER2 moieties [whole IgG, single-chain fragment variable (scFv), and peptide] for HER2-targeted PA tumor imaging. The binding affinity, cellular uptake, and in vivo biodistribution were examined. We propose 20-nm anti-HER2 scFv-conjugated IONPs (SNP20) as a novel PA contrast agent. SNP20 demonstrated high affinity and specific binding to HER2-expressing cells; it selectively visualized HER2-positive tumors in PA imaging studies. These data indicate that SNP20 is a potential PA contrast agent for imaging of HER2-expressing tumors. From the Clinical Editor: Iron oxide nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be good contrast agents for tumor imaging. They may also be useful in photoacoustic (PA) imaging, which can provide high sensitivity data and image resolution.

Here, we propose a novel Trojan-horse targeting strategy to hide or expose the targeting molecules of nanocarriers on-demand. The non-specific uptake by non-cancerous cells can be reduced because the targeting molecules are hidden in hydrophilic polymers. The nanocarriers are still actively targetable to cancer cells because the targeting molecules can be exposed on-demand at tumor regions. Typically, Fe3O4 nanocrystals (FN) as magnetic resonance imaging (Mm) contrast agents were encapsulated into albumin nanopartides (AN), and then folic acid (FA) and pH-sensitive polymers (PP) were grafted onto the surface of AN-FN to construct PP-FA-AN-FN nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results confirm successful construction of PP-FA-AN-FN. According to difference of nanoparticle-cellular uptake between pH 7.4 and 5.5, the weight ratio of conjugated PP to nanoparticle FA-AN-FN (i.e. graft density) and the molecular weight of PP (i.e. graft length) are optimized to be 132 and 5.7 kDa, respectively. In vitro studies confirm that the PP can hide ligand FA to prevent it from binding to cells with FR alpha at pH 7.4 and shrink to expose FA at pH 5.5. In vivo studies demonstrate that our Trojan-horse targeting strategy can reduce the nonspecific uptake of the PP-FA-AN-FN by non-cancerous cells. Therefore, our PP-FA-AN-FN might be used as an accurately targeted MRI contrast agent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Real-time imaging of in vivo distribution of photothermal agents and monitoring of post-treatment therapeutic outcomes are very important to design and optimize personalized PTT treatment. In this work, we used chitosan-stearic acid copolymer (CSO-SA) to encapsulate hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent tracer, DiR. Then, the surface of nanoparticles was further conjugated with a peptide (TNYL), which facilitates EphB4-positive tumor targeting delivery. Using a paired tumor mode in vivo and a double tumor-cell co-culture strategy in vitro, we demonstrated the feasibility of increasing the accumulation of our nanoparticles (DiR loaded and TNYL-CSO-SA coated HAuNS (DTCSH)) into EphB4-positive tumors through interaction between TNYL-peptide on the nanoparticles and EpHB4 receptors on tumor cells. When combined with NIR laser irradiation, our nanoparticles induced more EphB4-positive tumor cells death in vitro. We further developed optical imaging to temporally and spatially monitor the biodistribution of DTCSH. Under NIR laser irradiation, PIT exhibited dramatically stronger antitumor effect against EphB4-positive tumors than EphB4-negative tumors.

TWIST1 is a transcription factor whose reactivation in tumors leads to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), including increased cancer cell stemness, survival, and invasiveness. Additionally, TWIST1 drives angiogenesis via activation of IL-8 and CCL2, independent of VEGF signaling. In this work, results suggest that chemically modified siRNA against TWIST1 reverses EMT both in vitro and in vivo. siRNA delivery with a polyethyleneimine-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) led to reduction of TWIST1 target genes and migratory potential in vitro. In mice bearing xenograft tumors, weekly intravenous injections of the siRNA-nanoparticle complexes resulted in decreased tumor burden together with a loss of CCL2 suggesting a possible anti-angiogenic response. Therapeutic use of TWIST1 siRNA delivered via MSNs has the potential to inhibit tumor growth and progression in many solid tumor types. From the Clinical Editor: Tumor progression and metastasis eventually lead to patient mortality in the clinical setting. In other studies, it has been found that TWIST1, a transcription factor, if reactivated in tumors, would lead to downstream events including angiogenesis and result in poor prognosis in cancer patients. In this article, the authors were able to show that when siRNA against TWIST1 was delivered via mesoporous silica nanoparticle, there was tumor reduction in an in-vivo model. The results have opened up a new avenue for further research in this field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, these can result in tumor hypoxia, thus promoting tumor angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic agent sorafenib is hypothesized to improve outcomes; however, oral administration limits patient tolerance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to fabricate poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres for local sorafenib delivery to tumors during liver-directed embolotherapies. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) were co-encapsulated for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of microsphere delivery. Microspheres were fabricated using a double emulsion/solvent evaporation method and characterized for size, sorafenib and IONP content, and MRI properties. MRI was performed before and after intra-arterial microsphere infusions in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model. The microspheres were 13 microns in diameter with 8.8% and 0.89% (w/w) sorafenib and IONP, respectively. 21% and 28% of the loaded sorafenib and IONP, respectively, released within 72 h. Rabbit VX2 studies demonstrated that sorafenib microspheres normalized VEGFR 2 activity and decreased microvessel density.

This system is constructed by immobilizing acetals on the surface of mesoporous silica, and then coupling to ultra small lanthanide doped upconverting nanoparticle, which act as a gate keeper. The anticancer drug DOX is thus locked in the pores, and its burst release can be achieved under acidic environment on account of the hydrolyzation reactions of acetals. The nanogated drug release system is highly efficacious for cancer therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the nanocomposite could be harmlessly metabolized and degraded into apparently nontoxic products within a few days. The nanoscale effect of the system allows for passive tumor targeting and increased tumor accumulation of the probes via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, which is visualized by MRI in vivo.

The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect has been a key rationale for the development of stimulus-responsive nanocarriers to solid tumor. In this study, we developed a kind of novel nanocarrier, G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG, which was constructed with shrinkable gelatin nanoparticles coated, doxorubicin (DOX) tethered gold nanoparticles and long chain polyethylene glycol (PEG). The particle size of G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG was 186.5 nm with a zeta potential of -4.21 mV and the DOX loading capacity was 9.22%. In vitro, the G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG could be degraded by MMP-2 proteins with a size shrink from 186.5 nm to 593 nm. The release of DOX from G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG was in a pH- and time-dependent manner. At pH 5.0, the release of DOX was much quicker than that at high pH value and the cumulative release rate of DOX from G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG was approach 90.9%. Cellular uptake demonstrated that G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG could be internalized via the endosome-mediated pathway. Tumor spheroid penetration and collagen gel diffusion showed G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG with pre-incubation with MMP-2 could significantly enhance its penetrating efficiency. In vivo and ex vivo imaging exhibit that G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG could distribute into 4T1 and B16F10 tumor at a highest intensity. Correspondingly, 4T1 and B16F10 tumor bearing mice treated with G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG displayed the lowest tumor growth rate. In summary, the tumor microenvironment sensitive size-shrinkable G-AuNPs-DOX-PEG could deliver into deep tumor region and then release DOX, resulting in a best anti-tumor effect.

The obtained WS2-IO@MS-PEG composite nanoparticles exhibit many interesting inherent physical properties, including high near-infrared (NIR) light and X-ray absorbance, as well as strong superparamagnetism. In the mean time, the mesoporous silica shell in WS2-IO@MS-PEG could be loaded with a chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin (DOX), whose intracellular release afterwards may be triggered by NIR-induced photothermal heating for enhanced cancer cell killing.

Herein, a highly efficient photoacoustic treatment using gold nanorods (AuNRs) and its antitumor effect are reported. Folic acid conjugated AuNRs are designed to specifically target folate receptor-expressing cancer cells. Following photoacoustic treatment, most of the cancer cells with intracellular AuNRs die within 20 s. Compared with single-walled carbon nanotubes and indocyanine green containing nanoparticles, AuNRs can produce much stronger shock waves by absorbing the optical energy and thus induced the more efficient cell death at equal molar concentrations. In addition, the laser-induced shock waves can be detected for photoacoustic imaging. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the AuNR-mediated photoacoustic treatment resulted in efficient tumor suppression in mice. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photoacoustic treatment can be realized with a single-particle formulation.

However, these agents are limited when delivered intravenously due to their rapid clearance from the bloodstream and poor passage from the bloodstream into target tumours. Here we describe a novel stealthing strategy which addresses both these limitations and thereby demonstrate that both the passive andmechanically-mediated tumour accumulation of themodel nanomedicine adenovirus (Ad) can be substantially enhanced. In our strategy gold nanoparticles were thoroughly modified with 2 kDa polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and then linked to Ad via a single reductioncleavable 5 kDa PEG. The resulting Ad-gold-PEG construct was compared to non-modified Ad or conventionally stealthed Ad-poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide] (Ad-PHPMA). Notably, although Ad-gold-PEG was of similar size and surface charge to Ad-PHPMA the increase in density, resulting from the inclusion of the gold nanoparticles, provided a substantial enhancement of ultrasound-mediated transport. In an in vitro tumour mimicking phantom, the level and distance of Ad-gold-PEG transport was shown to be substantially greater than achieved with Ad-PHPMA. In in vivo studies 0.1% of an unmodified Ad dose was shown to accumulate in tumours, whereas over 12% of the injected dose was recovered from the tumours of mice treatedwith Ad-gold-PEG and ultrasound. Ultimately, a significant increase in anti-tumour efficacy resulted from this strategy. This stealthing and densityincreasing technology could ultimately enhance clinical utility of intravenously delivered nanoscale medicines including viruses, liposomes and antibodies.

Subsequently, these branched GNPs were biofunctionalized with cRGD cell penetrating-targeting peptides for photothermal cancer treatment applications. Branched GNPs conjugated with cRGD peptides enhanced internalization of the branched GNPs in BxPC3 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and effectively ablated BxPC3 cells when irradiated with a NIR laser (808 nm).

With this in mind, a type of intelligent mesoporous silica nanocarrier (PGFMSN) is proposed for matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP 2)-triggered tumor targeting and release by integrating programmed packing and MMP 2-degradable gelatin. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) are first functionalized with folic acid (FA) as a target ligand to improve cell uptake. Then gelatin is introduced onto FA-MSN via temperature-induced gelation, where gelatin layer blocks drugs inside the mesopores and protects the targeting ligand. To prolong blood-circulation lifetime, PEG is further decorated to obtain PGFMSN. All units are programmatically incorporated in a simple way and coordinated in an optimal fashion. Cells, multicellular spheroids and in vivo results demonstrate that PGFMSN is shielded against nonspecific uptake. After circulating to tumor tissue, the up-regulated MMP-2 hydrolyzes gelatin layer to deshield PEG and switch on the function of FA, which facilitate the selective uptake by tumor cells through folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis. Meanwhile, the packaged drug is released due to the shedding of gelatin layer. It is shown that doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded exhibits superior tumor targeting, drug internalization, cytotoxicity, and antitumor efficacy over free DOX, non-PEGylated and non-targeted nanoparticles, which provides potential applications for targeted cancer therapy.

Development of accurate and quantitative imaging techniques for non-invasive cell tracking can provide essential knowledge for elucidating these mechanisms. We designed a novel method for longitudinal and quantitative in vivo cell tracking, based on the superior visualization abilities of classical X-ray computed tomography (CT), combined with state-of-the-art nanotechnology. Herein, T-cells were transduced to express a melanoma-specific T-cell receptor and then labeled with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as a CT contrast agent. The GNP-labeled T-cells were injected intravenously to mice bearing human melanoma xenografts, and whole-body CT imaging allowed examination of the distribution, migration, and kinetics of T-cells. Using CT, we found that transduced T-cells accumulated at the tumor site, as opposed to nontransduced cells. Labeling with gold nanoparticles did not affect T-cell function, as demonstrated both in vitro, by cytokine release and proliferation assays, and in vivo, as tumor regression was observed. Moreover, to validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed cell tracking technique, T-cells were labeled both with green fluorescent protein for fluorescence imaging, and with GNPs for CT imaging. A remarkable correlation in signal intensity at the tumor site was observed between the two imaging modalities, at all time points examined, providing evidence for the accuracy of our CT cell tracking abilities.

Multifunctional MSNs can serve as all-in-one diagnostic and therapeutic tools that can be used to simultaneously visualize and treat various diseases, such as cancer. This research study is the first time that two lanthanide-based imaging systems have been combined to incorporate controlled drug release and targeted tracing into a single MSN-based nano-platform for a novel theranostic drug delivery system. Doping lanthanide ions, i.e., europium (Eu) and gadolinium (Gd) ions, into an MSN structure (EuGd-MSNs) imparts fluorescence and magnetism to the nanostructure that can be used to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biological fluorescence tools. Current cancer research has revealed that most human cancer cells express a large number of folate receptors on their surface. Grafting folic acid (FA) onto the EuGd-MSN surface (EuGd-FA-MSNs) imparts a targeting function to the MSN because of the specificity of the binding of FA to cell surface receptors. Furthermore, grafting anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin (CPT), onto the surface of these MSNs by forming disulfide bonds (EuGd-SS-CPT-FA-MSNs) enables intracellular controlled drug release. A high concentration of intracellular glutathione cleaves the disulfide bond to release the drug and treat the disease. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies show that the functionalized MSNs can be successfully used as a platform to integrate dual-imaging, targeting, and therapeutic treatment in multifunctional diagnosis drug delivery systems.

PTX improves the pharmaceutical efficacy of the first-line pancreatic cancer drug, gemcitabine (GEM), through suppression of the tumor stroma and inhibiting the expression of the GEM-inactivating enzyme, cytidine deaminase (CDA). We asked, therefore, whether it was possible to develop a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNP) carrier for pancreatic cancer to co-deliver a synergistic GEM/PTX combination. High drug loading was achieved by a custom-designed coated lipid film technique to encapsulate a calculated dose of GEM (40 wt %) by using a supported lipid bilayer (LB). The uniform coating of the 65 nm nanoparticles by a lipid membrane allowed incorporation of a sublethal amount of hydrophobic PTX, which could be co-delivered with GEM in pancreatic cells and tumors. We demonstrate that ratiometric PTX incorporation and delivery by our LB-MSNP could suppress CDA expression, contemporaneous with induction of oxidative stress as the operating principle for PTX synergy. To demonstrate the in vivo efficacy, mice carrying subcutaneous PANC-1 xenografts received intravenous (IV) injection of PTX/GEM-loaded LB-MSNP. Drug co-delivery provided more effective tumor shrinkage than GEM-loaded LB-MSNP, free GEM, or free GEM plus Abraxane. Comparable tumor shrinkage required coadministration of 12 times the amount of free Abraxane. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of tumor-associated GEM metabolites confirmed that, compared to free GEM, MSNP co-delivery increased the phosphorylated DNA-interactive GEM metabolite 13-fold and decreased the inactivated and deaminated metabolite 4-fold. IV injection of MSNP-delivered PTX/GEM in a PANC-1 orthotopic model effectively inhibited primary tumor growth and eliminated metastatic foci. The enhanced in vivo efficacy of the dual delivery carrier could be achieved with no evidence of local or systemic toxicity. In summary, we demonstrate the development of an effective LB-MSNP nanocarrier for synergistic PTX/GEM delivery in pancreatic cancer.",,,,,"Meng, Huan/AAM-1072-2020; Liu, Huiyu/B-5021-2012; Liu, Xiangsheng/W-3288-2019; Nel, Andre E/J-2808-2012; Meng, Huan/T-7954-2017","Meng, Huan/0000-0001-8844-3938; Liu, Xiangsheng/0000-0002-5719-2838; Meng, Huan/0000-0001-8844-3938; liu, hui yu/0000-0003-4465-8501",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,APR,2015,9,4,,,,,3540,3557,,10.1021/acsnano.5b00510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5b00510,,,,,,,,25776964,,,,,WOS:000353867000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, their potential has yet to be assessed in the in vivo application of peptide cancer vaccines. In this study, it is hypothesized that the immune distribution and adjuvant qualities of AuNPs could be leveraged to facilitate delivery of the ovalbumin (OVA) peptide antigen and the CpG adjuvant and enhance their therapeutic effect in a B16-OVA tumor model. AuNP delivery of OVA (AuNP-OVA) and of CpG (AuNP-CpG) enhanced the efficacy of both agents and induced strong antigen-specific responses. In addition, it is found that AuNP-OVA delivery alone, without CpG, is sufficient to promote significant antigen-specific responses, leading to subsequent anti-tumor activity and prolonged survival in both prophylactic and therapeutic in vivo tumor models. This enhanced therapeutic efficacy is likely due to the adjuvant effect of peptide coated AuNPs, as they induce inflammatory cytokine release when cultured with bone marrow dendritic cells. Overall, AuNP-mediated OVA peptide delivery can produce significant therapeutic benefits without the need of adjuvant, indicating that AuNPs are effective peptide vaccine carriers with the potential to permit the use of lower and safer adjuvant doses during vaccination.",,,,,,"Lin, Adam/0000-0001-9359-882X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1613-6810,1613-6829,,,,25-Mar,2015,11,12,,,,,1453,1459,,10.1002/smll.201402179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201402179,,,,,,,,25354691,,,,,WOS:000352553600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrate that SiO2@GN-Serum NPs have excellent biocompatibility. However, SiO2@GN-Serum-Dox NPs show higher cytotoxicity than SiO2@GN-Serum and free Dox under irradiation with NIR laser at 1.0 W/cm(2) for 5 min owing to both SiO2@GN-Serum-mediated photothermal ablation and cytotoxicity of light-triggered Dox release.

Nanotechnology is emerging as an efficient platform for theranostics, since nanoparticle-based contrast agents are powerful tools for enhancing in vivo imaging, while therapeutic nanoparticles may overcome several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems. Theranostic nanoparticles have drawn particular interest in cancer treatment, as they offer significant advantages over both common imaging contrast agents and chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the development of platforms for theranostic applications raises critical questions; is the optimal particle for therapy also the optimal particle for diagnostics? Are the specific characteristics needed to optimize diagnostic imaging parallel to those required for treatment applications? This issue is examined in the present study, by investigating the effect of the gold nanoparticle (GNP) size on tumor uptake and tumor imaging. A series of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor conjugated GNPs of different sizes (diameter range: 20-120 nm) was synthesized, and then their uptake by human squamous cell carcinoma head and neck cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo, as well as their tumor visualization capabilities were evaluated using CT. The results showed that the size of the nanoparticle plays an instrumental role in determining its potential activity in vivo. Interestingly, we found that although the highest tumor uptake was obtained with 20 nm C225-GNPs, the highest contrast enhancement in the tumor was obtained with 50 nm C225-GNPs, thus leading to the conclusion that the optimal particle size for drug delivery is not necessarily optimal for imaging.

The cell viability results demonstrated the encapsulation of DOX into BMSNs could lead to significantly enhanced therapeutic effect against multidrug-resistance cancer cells compared to that of free DOX drug. Furthermore, the comparable study of tumor growth by different treatments demonstrated that the introduction of BMSNs in the X-ray therapy could lead to higher therapeutic effect, with just 2.10-fold increase in tumor volume through 24 days, in comparison to 4.40-fold increase for X-ray beams treatment alone. Meanwhile, the in vitro interstitial radiotherapy experiments demonstrated that the cell inhibiting effect of P-32 interstitial radiotherapy combined with BMSNs (50 mu g/mL) was 1.55-fold higher than that of P-32 alone. Significantly, it is notable that the simultaneous chemo- and interstitial radiotherapy based on BMSNs could tremendously increase the therapeutic effect compared to those treatment alone. More importantly, the in vivo P-32 radiotherapy in conjunction with BMSNs was proved to present a significantly eradication of the tumor volumes by an average of 21% reduction to its initial values, in comparison to 2.01-fold increase in case of P-32 treatment alone.

Furthermore, confocal microscopic data of cell uptake suggest that less cytotoxicity of Dox-DSPIONs may be attributed to the cellular internalization of the conjugates and sustainable release of Dox from the formulation in the cytoplasm. More importantly, the results from the rabbit VX2 liver tumor model test under an external magnetic field showed that the conjugates had approximately twice the anti-tumor activity and two and a half times the animal survival rate, respectively, compared to free Dox.

Cellular uptake study showed obviously higher intensity of intracellular An-PEG-DOX-AuNPs compared with PEG-DOX-AuNPs. In vivo, An-PEG-DOX-AuNPs could distribute into glioma at a higher intensity than that of PEG-DOX-AuNPs and free DOX. Correspondingly, glioma-bearing mice treated with An-PEG-DOX-AuNPs displayed the longest median survival time, which was 2.89-fold longer than that of saline. In conclusion, An-PEG-DOX-AuNPs could specifically deliver and release DOX in glioma and significantly expand the median survival time of glioma-bearing mice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This confines in vivo uptake to the peritumoral space and results in high liver retention. In this study, we developed a viscosity modulated approach to synthesize ultrasmall silver sulfide quantum dots (QDs) with distinct tunable light emission from 500 to 1200 nm and a QD core diameter between 1.5 and 9 nm. Conjugation of a tumor-avid cyclic pentapeptide (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-Lys) resulted in monodisperse, water-soluble QDs (hydrodynamic diameter < 10 nm) without loss of the peptides high binding affinity to tumor-associated integrins (K-I = 1.8 nM/peptide). Fluorescence and electron microscopy showed that selective integrin-mediated internalization was observed only in cancer cells treated with the peptide-labeled QDs, demonstrating that the unlabeled hydrophilic nanoparticles exhibit characteristics of negatively charged fluorescent dye molecules, which typically do not internalize in cells. The biodistribution profiles of intravenously administered QDs in different mouse models of cancer reveal an exceptionally high tumor-to-liver uptake ratio, suggesting that the small sized QDs evaded conventional opsonization and subsequent high uptake in the liver and spleen. The seamless tunability of the QDs over a wide spectral range with only a small increase in size, as well as the ease of labeling the bright and noncytotoxic QDs with biomolecules, provides a platform for multiplexing information, tracking the trafficking of single molecules in cells, and selectively targeting disease biomarkers in living organisms without premature QD opsonization in circulating blood.",,,,,"Achilefu, Samuel/AAC-2401-2019; Tang, Rui/O-7426-2019","Tang, Rui/0000-0002-2734-1003; Achilefu, Samuel/0000-0002-3133-6717",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,JAN,2015,9,1,,,,,220,230,,10.1021/nn5071183,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn5071183,,,,,,,,25560768,,,,,WOS:000348619000023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The in vitro release studies showed that drug release from DOX-loaded cRGD-HNs (cRGD-HN-DOX) was minimal under physiological conditions but markedly accelerated upon NIR irradiation at a low power density of 0.2W/cm(2), due to photothermally induced phase transition of PCL regime. MTT assays showed that the antitumor activity of cRGD-HN-DOX in alpha(v)beta(3) integrin over-expressed human glioblastoma U87MG cells was greatly boosted by mild NIR irradiation, which was significantly more potent than non-targeting HN-DOX counterpart under otherwise the same conditions and was comparable or superior to free DOX, supporting receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. The in vivo pharmacokinetics studies showed that cRGD-HN-DOX had much longer circulation time than free DOX. The in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies revealed that cRGD-HN-DOX could actively target human U87MG glioma xenograft in nude mice. The therapeutic studies in human U87MG glioma xenografts exhibited that cRGD-HN-DOX in combination with NIR irradiation completely inhibited tumor growth and possessed much lower side effects than free DOX. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that all mice treated with cRGD-HN-DOX plus NIR irradiation survived over an experimental period of 48 days while control groups treated with PBS, cRGD-HN-DOX, cRGD-HNs with NIR irradiation, free DOX, or HN-DOX with NIR irradiation (non-targeting control) had short life spans of 15-40 days.

New versions of RNAi-based therapy are greatly required to tackle the challenges of lung cancer. In this study, we developed a novel siRNA delivery vector based on our magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs) platform. This nanocarrier was constructed by loading siRNAs into the mesopores of M-MSNs, followed by polyethylenimine (PEI) capping, PEGylation and fusogenic peptide KALA modification. The resultant delivery system exhibited prolonged half-life in bloodstream, enhanced cell membrane translocation and endosomal escapablity, and favorable tissue biocompatibility and biosafety. Systemic application of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) siRNA via this nanocarrier resulted in remarkable tumor suppression, both in subdermal and orthotopic lung cancer models, while tumor metastasis was also significantly reduced, overall leading to improved survival. In addition, the magnetic core of the particles and the functionalized fluorescence markers conveniently enabled in vivo imaging of target tissues.

In this work, a near-infrared (NIR) heptamethine indocyanine dye, IR825, in the presence of cationic polymer, polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH), forms J-aggregates with red-shifted and significantly enhanced absorbance. After further complexing with ultra-small iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and the followed functionalization with polyethylene glycol (PEG), the obtained IR825@PAH-IONP-PEG composite nanoparticles are highly stable in different physiological media. With a sharp absorbance peak, IR825@PAH-IONP-PEG can serve as an effective photothermal agent under laser irradiation at 915 nm, which appears to be optimal in photothermal therapy application considering its improved tissue penetration compared with 808-nm light and much lower water heating in comparison to 980-nm light. As revealed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, those nanoparticles after intravenous injection exhibit high tumor accumulation, which is then harnessed for in vivo photothermal ablation of tumors, achieving excellent therapeutic efficacy in a mouse tumor model.

The short blood circulation lifetime of AuNCs, however, limits their tumor uptake and thus in vivo applications. Here we show that such a limitation can be overcome by cloaking AuNCs with red blood cell (RBC) membranes, a natural stealth coating. The fusion of RBC membranes over AuNC surface does not alter the unique porous and hollow structures of AuNCs, and the resulting RBC-membrane-coated AuNCs (RBC-AuNCs) exhibit good colloidal stability. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the RBC-AuNCs demonstrate in vitro photothermal effects and selectively ablate cancerous cells within the irradiation zone as do the pristine biopolymer-stealth-coated AuNCs. Moreover, the RBC-AuNCs exhibit significantly enhanced in vivo blood retention and circulation lifetime compared to the biopolymer-stealth-coated counterparts, as demonstrated using a mouse model. With integrated advantages of photothermal effects from AuNCs and long blood circulation lifetime from RBCs, the RBC-AuNCs demonstrate drastically enhanced tumor uptake when administered systematically, and mice that received PPT cancer treatment modulated by RBC-AuNCs achieve 100% survival over a span of 45 days.

Inhibition of MGMT using O(6)-benzylguanine (BG) has shown promise in these patients, but its clinical use is hindered by poor pharmacokinetics that leads to unacceptable toxicity. To improve BG biodistribution and efficacy, we developed superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (NP) for targeted convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of BG to GBM. The nanoparticles (NPCP-BG-CTX) consist of a magnetic core coated with a redox-responsive, cross-linked, biocompatible chitosan-PEG copolymer surface coating (NPCP). NPCP was modified through covalent attachment of BG and tumor targeting peptide chlorotoxin (CTX). Controlled, localized BG release was achieved under reductive intracellular conditions and NPCP-BG-CTX demonstrated proper trafficking of BG in human GBM cells in vitro. NPCP-BG-CTX treated cells showed a significant reduction in MGMT activity and the potentiation of TMZ toxicity. In vivo, CED of NPCP-BG-CTX produced an excellent volume of distribution (Vd) within the brain of mice bearing orthotopic human primary GBM xenografts. Significantly, concurrent treatment with NPCP-BG-CTX and TMZ showed a 3-fold increase in median overall survival in comparison to NPCP-CTX/TMZ treated and untreated animals. Furthermore, NPCP-BG-CTX mitigated the myelosuppression observed with free BG in wild-type mice when administered concurrently with TMZ. The combination of favorable physicochemical properties, tumor cell specific BG delivery, controlled BG release, and improved in vivo efficacy demonstrates the great potential of these NPs as a treatment option that could lead to improved clinical outcomes.",,,,,"Zhang, Miqin/F-5537-2010; Veiseh, Omid/GLS-9547-2022; Veiseh, Omid/N-1137-2019","Zhang, Miqin/0000-0001-8974-1494; Veiseh, Omid/0000-0003-1153-8079; Kievit, Forrest/0000-0002-9847-783X; Stephen, Zachary/0000-0002-2014-3100",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,OCT,2014,8,10,,,,,10383,10395,,10.1021/nn503735w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn503735w,,,,,,,,25247850,,,,,WOS:000343952600073,View Full Record in Web of Science

Firstly, adamantanamine was grafted onto the orifices of HMSNs using a redox-cleavable disulfide bond as an intermediate linker. Subsequently, a synthetic functional molecule, lactobionic acid-grafted-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD-LA), was immobilized on the surface of HMSNs through specific complexation with the adamantyl group, where beta-CD served as an end-capper to keep the loaded drug within HMSNs. beta-CD-LA on HMSNs could also act as a targeting agent towards tumor cells (i.e., HepG2 cells), since the lactose group in beta-CD-LA is a specific ligand binding with the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) on HepG2 cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that DOX-loaded nanoreservoirs could be selectively endocytosed by HepG2 cells, releasing therapeutic DOX into cytoplasm and efficiently inducing the apoptosis and cell death. In vivo investigations further confirmed that DOX-loaded nanoreservoirs could permeate into the tumor sites and actively interact with tumor cells, which inhibited the tumor growth with the minimized side effect.

However, there is little work that has been published to investigate the influence of the definite density of the FA ligands on the active targeting of nanocarriers. In this study, we have combined magnetic-guided iron oxide nanoparticles with FA ligands, adjusted the FA ligand density and then studied the resulting effects on the active targeting ability of this dual-targeting drug delivery system to tumor cells. We have also optimized the FA ligand density of the drug delivery system for their active targeting to FR-overexpressing tumor cells in vitro. Prussian blue staining, semi-thin section of cells observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) have shown that the optimal FA density is from 2.3 x 10(18) to 2.5 x 10(18) per gram nanoparticles ((g.NPs)(-1)). We have further tried to qualitatively and quantitatively control the active targeting and delivering of drugs to tumors on 4T1-bearing BALB/c mice.

Here we designed an activatable theranostic nanoprobe (ATNP) via self-assembly of activatable aptamer probes (AAPs) on Au@Ag/Au nanoparticles (NPs). As both quenchers and heaters, novel Au@Ag/Au NPs were prepared, showing excellent fluorescence quenching and more effective near-infrared photothermal therapy than Au nanorods. The AAP comprised a thiolated aptamer and a fluorophore-labeled complementary DNA; thus, the ATNP with quenched fluorescence in the free state could realize signal activation through target binding-induced conformational change of the AAP, and then achieve on-demand treatment under image-guided irradiation. By using S6 aptamer as the model, in vitro and in vivo studies of A549 lung cancer verified that the ATNP greatly improved imaging contrast and specific destruction, suggesting a robust and versatile theranostic strategy for personalized medicine in future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2040-3364,2040-3372,,,,7-Aug,2014,6,15,,,,,8754,8761,,10.1039/c4nr01927j,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4nr01927j,,,,,,,,24953128,,,,,WOS:000339861500045,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herein, we report the use of multifunctional dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Au DENPs) covalently linked with alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TOS) as a platform for targeted cancer computed tomography (CT) imaging and therapy. In this study, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers of generation 5 (G5.NH2) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FI), polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified alpha-TOS, and PEGylated folic acid (FA) were used as templates to synthesize Au DENPs, followed by acetylation of the remaining dendrimer terminal amines. The formed multifunctional Au DENPs were characterized via different techniques. We show that the Au DENPs conjugated with approximately 9.8 alpha-TOS molecules per dendrimer and with an Au core size of 33 nm are water-dispersible, and stable under different pH and temperature conditions and in different aqueous media. The FA modification onto the Au DENPs enables efficient targeting of the particles to cancer cells overexpressing FA receptors (FAR), and effective targeted CT imaging of the cancer cells in vitro and the xenografted tumor model in vivo. Likewise, the covalent conjugation of alpha-TOS does not compromise its therapeutic activity, instead significantly improves its water solubility. Importantly, thanks to the role of FA-directed targeting, the formed multifunctional Au DENPs are able to exert the specific therapeutic efficacy of alpha-TOS to the FAR-overexpressing cancer cells in vitro and the xenografted tumor model in vivo. The developed multifunctional Au DENPs may hold a great promise to be used as a unique theranostic nanoplatform for targeted CT imaging and therapy of different types of cancer.

Herein, we show that in addition to the nanomaterial-mediated photothermal effects (NmPTT), gold nanoshells (including, nanocages, nanorod-in-shell and nanoparticle-in-shell) not only are able to absorb NIR light, but can also emit fluorescence, sensitize formation of singlet oxygen and exert nanomaterial-mediated photodynamic therapeutic (NmPDT) complete destruction of solid tumors in mice. The modes of NmPDT and NmPTT can be controlled and switched from one to the other by changing the excitation wavelength. In the in vitro experiments, gold nanocages and nanorod-in-shell show larger percentage of cellular deaths originating from NmPDT along with the minor fraction of NmPTT effects. In contrast, nanoparticle-in-shell exhibits larger fraction of NmPTT-induced cellular deaths together with minor fraction of NmPDT-induced apoptosis. Fluorescence emission spectra and DPBF quenching studies confirm the generation of singlet 02 upon NIR photoirradiation. Both NmPDT and NmPTT effects were confirmed by measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent sodium azide quenching, heat shock protein expression (HSP 70), singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) sensing, changes in mitochondria membrane potential and apoptosis in the cellular experiments. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that upon irradiation at 980 nm under ultra-low doses (similar to 150 mW/cm(2)), gold nanocages mostly exert NmPDT effect to effectively suppress the B16F0 melanoma tumor growth. The combination of NmPDT and NmPTT effects on destruction of solid tumors is far better than pure NmPTT effect by 808 nm irradiation and also doxorubicin. Overall, our study demonstrates that gold nanoshells can serve as excellent multi-functional theranostic agents (fluorescence imaging + NmPDT + NmPTT) upon single photon NIR light excitation under ultra-low laser doses.

However, patient tolerance is often poor due to common systemic side effects following oral administration. Local transcatheter delivery of sorafenib to liver tumors has the potential to reduce systemic toxicities while increasing the dose delivered to targeted tumors. We developed sorafenib-eluting PLG microspheres for delivery by intra-hepatic transcatheter infusion in an orthotropic rodent HCC model. The particles also encapsulated iron-oxide nanoparticles permitting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of intra-hepatic biodistributions. The PLG microspheres (diameter approximate to 1 mu m) were loaded with 18.6% (w/w) sorafenib and 0.54% (w/w) ferrofluid and 65.2% of the sorafenib was released within 72 h of media exposure. In vitro studies demonstrated significant reductions in HCC cell proliferation with increasing doses of the sorafenib-eluting microspheres, where the estimated IC50 was a 29 mu g/mL dose of microspheres. During in vivo studies, MRI permitted intra-procedural visualization of intra-hepatic microsphere delivery. At 72 h after microsphere infusion, microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors treated with the sorafenibeluting microspheres compared to both sham control tumors (by 35%) and controls (by 30%).

A pH triggered charge-reversible polymer and a water-soluble cationic conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) were sequentially deposited onto the AuNP surface through electrostatic interaction. The obtained hybrid probe is monodispersed with an average diameter of 68.3 nm by dynamic light scattering measurement. In physiological conditions (pH approximate to 7.4), the hybrid probe is almost non-fluorescent due to the super-quenching of CPE by AuNPs via energy/charge transfer and efficient exciton migration along the polymer backbone. When exposed to acidic extracellular microenvironments in tumor (pH(e) approximate to 6.5), the acid-labile amides hydrolyze into primary amines. The generated amine groups result in strong electrostatic repulsion between CPE and AuNPs, leading to recovered probe fluorescence. The fluorescence turn-on is further utilized for tumor extracellular acidic microenvironment imaging. In addition, under in vivo conditions, the nanosized hybrid probe exhibits specific accumulation in tumor tissue with light-up fluorescence, which provides new opportunities for easy tumor imaging and identification.",,,,,"Liu, Bin/K-6445-2012; Yuan, Youyong/L-4466-2017; Li, Kai/H-4271-2018","Liu, Bin/0000-0002-0956-2777; Yuan, Youyong/0000-0003-2784-3780; Li, Kai/0000-0003-1664-5439",,,,,,,,,,,,,1613-6810,1613-6829,,,,28-May,2014,10,10,,,,,1967,1975,,10.1002/smll.201302765,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201302765,,,,,,,,24616338,,,,,WOS:000336611000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we describe a novel approach to fabricating lactobionic acid (LA)-modified dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (LA-Au DENPs) for in vitro and in vivo targeted CT imaging of human hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers of generation 5 pre-modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate and poly(ethylene glycol)-linked LA were employed as templates to form Au nanoparticles. The remaining dendrimer terminal amines were subjected to an acetylation reaction to form LA-Au DENPs. The prepared LA-Au DENPs were characterized via different methods. Our results reveal that the multifunctional Au DENPs with a Au core size of 2.7 nm have good stability under different pH (5-8) and temperature (4-50 degrees C) conditions and in different aqueous media, and are noncytotoxic to normal cells but cytotoxic to the targeted hepatocarcinoma cells in the given concentration range. In vitro flow cytometry data show that the LA-Au DENPs can be specifically uptaken by a model hepatocarcinoma cell line overexpressing asialoglycoprotein receptors through an active receptor-mediated targeting pathway. Importantly, the LA-Au DENPs can be used as a highly effective nanoprobe for specific CT imaging of hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and the xenoplanted tumor model in vivo.

Apt-HAuNS was characterized in terms of size, surface charge, absorption, and number of aptamers per particle. The in vivo pharmacokinetics, in vivo biodistribution, and micro-SPECT/CT imaging of In-111-labeled apt-HAuNS and anti-EGFR antibody (C225)-conjugated HAuNS were evaluated in nude mice bearing highly malignant human OSC-19 oral tumors.

Apt-HAuNS did not have an altered absorbance profile or size (lambda(max) = 800 nm; diameter = 55 nm) compared to C225-HAuNS or PEG-HAuNS. The surface charge became more negative upon conjugation of the aptamer (-51.4 vs -19.0 for PEG-HAuNS and -25.0 for C225-HAuNS). The number of aptamers/particle was similar to 250. In vitro cell binding and in vivo biodistribution showed selective binding of the apt-HAuNS to EGFR. mu SPECT/CT imaging confirmed that there was more tumor uptake of apt-HAuNS than C225-HAuNS.

A crucial aspect of this therapy is the nanoparticle size for optimal tumor uptake. A class of nanoparticles known as hollow Au (or Au-Ag) nanoshells (HGNS) is appealing because near-IR resonances are achievable in this system with diameters less than 100 nm. However, in this study, we report a surprising finding that in vivo HGNS are unstable, fragmenting with the Au and the remnants of the sacrificial Ag core accumulating differently in various organs. We synthesized 43, 62, and 82 nm diameter HGNS through a galvanic replacement reaction, with nanoparticles of all sizes showing virtually identical NIR resonances at similar to 800 nm. A theoretical model indicated that alloying, residual Ag in the nanoparticle core, nanoparticle porosity, and surface defects all contribute to the presence of the plasmon resonance at the observed wavelength, with the major contributing factor being the residual Ag. While PEG functionalization resulted in stable nanoparticles under laser irradiation in solution, an anomalous, strongly element-specific biodistribution observed in tumor-bearing mice suggests that an avid fragmentation of all three sizes of nanoparticles occurred in vivo. Stability studies across a wide range of pH environments and in serum confirmed HGNS fragmentation. These results show that NIR resonant HGNS contain residual Ag, which does not stay contained within the HGNS in vivo. This demonstrates the importance of tracking both materials of a galvanic replacement nanoparticle in bidistribution studies and of performing thorough nanoparticle stability studies prior to any intended in vivo trial application.",,,,,"Knight, Mark W/E-3089-2010; Nordlander, Peter/A-2560-2008; Halas, Naomi/D-2935-2011; Neumann, Oara/A-7280-2019; Neumann, Oara/AAX-3518-2020","Knight, Mark W/0000-0001-7625-403X; Nordlander, Peter/0000-0002-1633-2937; Halas, Naomi/0000-0002-8461-8494; Joshi, Amit/0000-0002-7590-2522",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,APR,2014,8,4,,,,,3222,3231,,10.1021/nn405663h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn405663h,,,,,,,,24547810,,,,,WOS:000334990600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Combination of Au NRs-mediated PTT and organic photosensitizers-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) were also reported to achieve synergistic PTT and PDT effects on killing cancer cells. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that Au NRs alone can sensitize formation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and exert dramatic PDT effects on complete destrcution of tumors in mice under very low LED/laser doses of single photon NIR (915 nm, <130 mW/cm(2)) light excitation. By changing the NIR light excitation wavelengths, Au NRs-mediated phototherapeutic effects can be switched from PDT to PTT or combination of both. Both PDT and PTT effects were confirmed by measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat shock protein (HSP 70), singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) sensing, and sodium azide quenching in cellular experiments. In vivo mice experiments further show that the PDT effect via irradiation of Au NRs by 915 nm can destruct the B16F0 melanoma tumor in mice far more effectively than doxorubicin (a clinically used anti-cancer drug) as well as the PTT effect (via irradiation of Au NRs by 780 nm light).

The resultant Au-tripods with size less than 20 nm showed great promise as contrast agents for in vivo photoacoustic imaging (PAT). We further identified Au-tripods with two possible configurations as high-absorbance nanomaterials from various gold multipods using a numerical simulation analysis. The PAT signals were linearly correlated with their concentrations after subcutaneous injection. The in vivo biodistribution of Au-tripods favorable for molecular imaging was confirmed using small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Intravenous administration of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys (RGDfC) peptide conjugated Au-tripods (RGD-Au-tripods) to U87MG tumor-bearing mice showed PAL contrasts in tumors almost 3-fold higher than for the blocking group. PAT results correlated well with the corresponding PET images. Quantitative biodistribution data revealed that 7.9% ID/g of RGD-Au-tripods had accumulated in the U87MG tumor after 24 h post-injection.

This character can be exploited for improving the selectivity of radiotherapy. However, such an improvement is possible only if irradiation is performed when the gold content is high in the tumor and low in the surrounding healthy tissue. As a result, the beneficial action of irradiation (the eradication of the tumor) should occur while the deleterious side effects of radiotherapy should be limited by sparing the healthy tissue. The location of the radiosensitizers is therefore required to initiate the radiotherapy. Designing gold nanoparticles for monitoring their distribution by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an asset due to the high resolution of MRI which permits the accurate location of particles and therefore the determination of the optimal time for the irradiation. We recently demonstrated that ultrasmall gold nanoparticles coated by gadolinium chelates (Au@DTDTPA-Gd) can be followed up by MRI after intravenous injection. Herein, Au@DTDTPA and Au@DTDTPA-Gd were prepared in order to evaluate their potential for radiosensitization. Comet assays and in vivo experiments suggest that these particles appear well suited for improving the selectivity of the radiotherapy. The dose which is used for inducing similar levels of DNA alteration is divided by two when cells are incubated with the gold nanoparticles prior to the irradiation. Moreover, the increase in the lifespan of tumor bearing rats is more important when the irradiation is performed after the injection of the gold nanoparticles. In the case of treatment of rats with a brain tumor (9L gliosarcoma, a radio-resistant tumor in a radiosensitive organ), the delay between the intravenous injection and the irradiation was determined by MRI.",,,,,"Mandon, Céline/Q-3989-2018; Billotey, Claire/L-7282-2019; Roux, Stephane/X-1326-2019; Dutour, Aurelie/D-8527-2014; Roux, Stéphane/S-4514-2017; Brӓuer-Krisch, Elke T/O-6026-2017; DUFORT, Sandrine C/M-2827-2013; Coll, Jean-Luc/G-2520-2013; laurent, gautier/E-1498-2017","Mandon, Céline/0000-0002-2104-6660; Billotey, Claire/0000-0001-7895-6123; Roux, Stephane/0000-0003-4885-6732; Roux, Stéphane/0000-0002-5198-1916; Brӓuer-Krisch, Elke T/0000-0003-4587-1160; Coll, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-2453-3552; laurent, gautier/0000-0002-8544-1379; Janier, Marc/0000-0001-5937-9180",,,,,,,,,,,,,1613-6810,1613-6829,,,,MAR,2014,10,6,,,,,1116,1124,,10.1002/smll.201302303,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201302303,,,,,,,,24677791,,,,,WOS:000333538000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this report, the design and characterization of novel multifunctional theranostic nanoparticles (TNPs) is described for enzyme-specific drug activation at tumor sites and simultaneous in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of drug delivery. TNPs are synthesized by conjugation of FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticles ferumoxytol to an MMP-activatable peptide conjugate of azademethylcolchicine (ICT), creating CLIO-ICTs (TNPs). Significant cell death is observed in TNP-treated MMP-14 positive MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cells in vitro, but not MMP-14 negative fibroblasts or cells treated with ferumoxytol alone. Intravenous administration of TNPs to MMTV-PyMT tumor-bearing mice and subsequent MRI demonstrates significant tumor selective accumulation of the TNP, an observation confirmed by histopathology. Treatment with CLIO-ICTs induces a significant antitumor effect and tumor necrosis, a response not observed with ferumoxytol. Furthermore, no toxicity or cell death is observed in normal tissues following treatment with CLIO-ICTs, ICT, or ferumoxytol. These findings demonstrate proof of concept for a new nanotemplate that integrates tumor specificity, drug delivery and in vivo imaging into a single TNP entity through attachment of enzyme-activated prodrugs onto magnetic nanoparticles.

Nanoparticles, produced by a non-emulsion technique, were fabricated to carry iron oxide within the shell and the chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide (TMZ), as the payload. Nanoparticle properties were characterized and subsequently their endocytosis-mediated uptake by glioma cells was demonstrated. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) can disperse nanoparticles through the rodent brain and their distribution is accurately visualized by MRI. Infusion of nanoparticles does not result in observable animal toxicity relative to control.

The low biotoxicity of Ag2S QDs indicated that they are promisingly safe nanoparticles for bio-applications. Furthermore, the selective imaging and favorable tumor inhibition of the nanoconjugates were demonstrated at both cell and animal levels.

In in vitro cell viability assay on human NSCLC H1299 cells, the half-maximum inhibiting concentration (IC50) of HMSNs-BTZ was 42% of that for free BTZ in 48 h treatments. In vivo tumor-suppression assay further indicated that HMSNs-BTZ (0.3 mg/kg) showed approximately 1.5 folds stronger anti-tumor activity than free BTZ. Furthermore, we report that more potent induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death, along with promoted activation of Caspase 3 and autophagy might mechanistically underlie the improved antitumor efficacy of HMSNs-BTZ. Finally, the tumor-suppressing effect of HMSNs-BTZ was enhanced in the presence of wild-type p53 signaling, suggesting a potential enhancement in clinical efficacy with combined p53 gene therapy and BTZ-based chemotherapy.

In vitro cell cytotoxicity tests on cancer cells verify that the DOX-loaded UCNPs@mSiO(2)-PEG has comparable cytotoxicity with free DOX at the same concentration of DOX. In addition, the T-1-weighted MRI that measures in aqueous solutions reveals that the contrast brightening increases with the concentration of Gd3+ component.

However, in vivo real-time monitoring of Dox release and temperature achieved during the laser ablation technique has not been previously demonstrated before. In this study, we used fluorescence optical imaging tomap the release of Dox from Dox@PEG-HAuNS and photoacoustic imaging to monitor the tumor temperature achieved during near-infrared laser-induced photothermal heating in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, treatment with a 3-W laser was sufficient to initiate the release of Dox from Dox@PEG-HAuNS (1: 3: 1 wt/wt, 1.32 x 10(12) particles/mL). Laser powers of 3 and 6 W achieved ablative temperatures of more than 50 degrees C. In 4T1 tumor-bearing nude mice that received intratumoral or intravenous injections of Dox@PEG-HAuNS, fluorescence optical imaging (emission wavelength = 600 nm, excitation wavelength = 500 nm) revealed that the fluorescence intensity in surface laser-treated tumors 24 h after treatment was significantly higher than that in untreated tumors (p = 0.015 for intratumoral, p = 0.008 for intravenous). Similar results were obtained using an interstitial laser to irradiate tumors following the intravenous injection of Dox@PEG-HAuNS (p = 0.002 at t = 24 h). Photoacoustic imaging (acquisition wavelength = 800 nm) revealed that laser treatment caused a substantial increase in tumor temperature, from 37 degrees C to ablative temperatures of more than 50 degrees C. Ex vivo analysis revealed that the fluorescence intensity of laser-treated tumors was twice as high as that of untreated tumors (p = 0.009). Histological analysis confirmed that intratumoral injection of Dox@PEG-HAuNS and laser treatment caused significantly more tumor necrosis compared to tumors that were not treated with laser (p < 0.001). On the basis of these findings, we conclude that fluorescence optical imaging and photoacoustic imaging are promising approaches to assessing Dox release and monitoring temperature, respectively, after Dox@PEG-HAuNS-mediated thermal ablation therapy.

In this study, transferrin-conjugated magnetic silica PLGA nanoparticles (MNP-MSN-PLGA-Tf NPs) were formulated to overcome these barriers. These NPs were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX), and their anti-proliferative effect was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro cytotoxicity of drug-loaded NPs was evaluated in U-87 cells. The delivery and the subsequent cellular uptake of drug-loaded NPs could be enhanced by the presence of magnetic field and the usage of Tf as targeting ligand, respectively. In particular, cells treated with DOX-PTX-NPs-Tf with magnetic field showed the highest cytotoxicity as compared to those treated with DOX-PTX-NPs-Tf, DOX-PTX-NPs, DOX-PTX-NPs-Tf with free Tf. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy of drug-loaded NPs was evaluated in intracranial U-87 MG-luc2 xenograft of BALB/c nude mice. In particular, the DOX-PTX-NPs-Tf treatment exhibited the strongest anti-glioma activity as compared to the PTX-NPs-Tf, DOX-NPs-Tf or DOX-PTX-NPs treatment. Mice did not show acute toxicity after administrating with blank MNP-MSN-PLGA-Tf NPs.

The in vitro and in vivo investigations showed that Mn-SiO2 has unique MR contrast-enhancing characteristics that activate positive contrast enhancement in T-1-weighted MR images only under low pH conditions by liberating Mn2+ ions from MR inactive nanoparticles. The administration of Mn-SiO2 to an orthotopic xenograft model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulted in a differentiation of enhancement periods between HCC and normal parenchyma tissues on T-1-weighted MR images and consequently presented the duplicates of the highly contrast-enhanced liver image with an equal liver-to-HCC contrast ratio but opposite contrast. The Mn-SiO2-enhanced MR imaging therefore allowed for the repetitive detection of the HCC within a single MR imaging session, which can help us to achieve more reliable diagnosis and characterization of liver lesions than is possible with any currently used Mn2+-based contrast agent. In addition, the in vivo biodistribution study also supported the effectiveness of Mn-SiO2 nanoparticles as a liver-specific MRI contrast agent, which efficiently delivers and releases the T-1-contrasting Mn2+ ions to targeted hepatocytes.

The aminated Fe3O4 NPs with PEI coating enabled covalent conjugation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FI) and folate-conjugated polyethylene glycol (PEG) with one end of carboxyl groups (FA-PEG-COOH). Followed by final acetylation, FA-targeted PEGylated Fe3O4 NPs (Fe3O4-PEI-Ac-FI-PEG-FA NPs) were formed. The formed multifunctional Fe3O4 NPs were characterized via different techniques. We show that the PEI-mediated approach along with the PEGylation conjugation enables the generation of water-dispersible and stable multifunctional Fe3O4 NPs, and the particles are quite cytocompatible and hemocompatible in the given concentration range as confirmed by in vitro cytotoxicity assay, cell morphology observation, and hemolysis assay. In addition, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy data show that the multifunctional Fe3O4 NPs are able to target a model cancer cell line (KB cells) overexpressing FA receptors in vitro. Importantly, the FA-targeted Fe3O4 NPs are able to be used as an efficient nanoprobe for MR imaging of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted tumor model in vivo via an active FA targeting pathway.

An incomplete understanding of how cataloged genetic aberrations promote therapy resistance, combined with ineffective drug delivery to the central nervous system, has rendered GBM incurable. Functional genomics efforts have implicated several oncogenes in GBM pathogenesis but have rarely led to the implementation of targeted therapies. This is partly because many undruggable oncogenes cannot be targeted by small molecules or antibodies. We preclinically evaluate an RNA interference (RNAi)-based nanomedicine platform, based on spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanoparticle conjugates, to neutralize oncogene expression in GBM. SNAs consist of gold nanoparticles covalently functionalized with densely packed, highly oriented small interfering RNA duplexes. In the absence of auxiliary transfection strategies or chemical modifications, SNAs efficiently entered primary and transformed glial cells in vitro. In vivo, the SNAs penetrated the blood-brain barrier and blood-tumor barrier to disseminate throughout xenogeneic glioma explants. SNAs targeting the oncoprotein Bcl2Like12 (Bcl2L12)-an effector caspase and p53 inhibitor overexpressed in GBM relative to normal brain and low-grade astrocytomas-were effective in knocking down endogenous Bcl2L12 mRNA and protein levels, and sensitized glioma cells toward therapy-induced apoptosis by enhancing effector caspase and p53 activity. Further, systemically delivered SNAs reduced Bcl2L12 expression in intracerebral GBM, increased intratumoral apoptosis, and reduced tumor burden and progression in xenografted mice, without adverse side effects. Thus, silencing antiapoptotic signaling using SNAs represents a new approach for systemic RNAi therapy for GBM and possibly other lethal malignancies.",,,,,"Mirkin, Chad A/E-3911-2010; Cutler, Joshua I/C-4419-2011; Day, Emily S/A-9026-2012; Ko, Caroline H/E-6877-2010","Day, Emily S/0000-0002-8707-826X; Mirkin, Chad/0000-0002-6634-7627",,,,,,,,,,,,,1946-6234,1946-6242,,,,30-Oct,2013,5,209,,,,,,,209ra152,10.1126/scitranslmed.3006839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3006839,,,,,,,,24174328,,,,,WOS:000326501700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Systematic in vivo tumor targeting studies clearly demonstrated that Cu-64-NOTA-mSiO(2)-PEG-TRC10S could accumulate prominently at the 4T1 tumor site via both the enhanced permeability and retention effect and TRC105-mediated binding to tumor vasculature CD105. As a proof-of-concept, we also demonstrated successful enhanced tumor targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice after intravenous injection of DOX-loaded NOTA-mSiO(2)-PEG-TRC105, which holds great potential for future image-guided drug delivery and targeted cancer therapy.",,,,,"Valdovinos, Hector F/D-6323-2016; Kwon, Glen S/A-1919-2014; Chen, Feng/O-2967-2013; Cai, Weibo/B-9174-2008; Zhang, Yin/E-6547-2015","Valdovinos, Hector F/0000-0001-5156-4146; Cai, Weibo/0000-0003-4641-0833; Barnhart, Todd/0000-0002-9981-2150; , Glen/0000-0002-4798-652X; Shi, Sixiang/0000-0002-8354-7620",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,OCT,2013,7,10,,,,,9027,9039,,10.1021/nn403617J,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn403617J,,,,,,,,24083623,,,,,WOS:000326209100075,View Full Record in Web of Science

Few examples however of suchlike in vivo applications have been described so far. In this study, we report the use of siRNA/RGD gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in a lung cancer syngeneic orthotopic murine model. Therapeutic RGD-nanoparticle treatment resulted in successful targeting evident from significant c-myc oncogene down-regulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of lung tumor bearing mice, possibly via alpha v beta 3 integrin interaction. Our results suggest that RGD gold nanoparticles-mediated delivery of siRNA by intratracheal instillation in mice leads to successful suppression of tumor cell proliferation and respective tumor size reduction. These results reiterate the capability of functionalized gold nanoparticles for targeted delivery of siRNA to cancer cells towards effective silencing of the specific target oncogene. What is more, we demonstrate that the gold-nanoconjugates trigger a complex inflammatory and immune response that might promote the therapeutic effect of the RNAi to reduce tumor size with low doses of siRNA.

The targeting probe has a magnetite nanocrystal (Fe3O4@PSMA) core and a polynucleotide shell that carries 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (anti-HER2) antibody for cancer cell-specific targeting. The targeting nanocrystals play as an important role to relay the externally delivered radiofrequency energy for tumor hyperthermia. Locoregional heat then triggers a drug release from the oligonucleotide carrier as it directly damages tumor cells.

After tail vein injection, the SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs were found selectively accumulate at the tumor site. Encapsulation of ICG into the lipid coating of SPIO NPs results in higher photostability than free ICG due to the protection from degradation.

The octapod iron oxide nanoparticles (edge length of 30 nm) exhibit an ultrahigh transverse relaxivity value (679.3 +/- 30 mM(-1)s(-1)), indicating that these octapod iron oxide nanoparticles are much more effective T-2 contrast agents for in vivo imaging and small tumour detection in comparison with conventional iron oxide nanoparticles, which holds great promise for highly sensitive, early stage and accurate detection of cancer in the clinic.",,,,,"Bao, Jianfeng/AAS-4331-2020; Ni, Kaiyuan/B-3569-2016; Chen, Xiaoyuan/D-1860-2014; Zhou, Zijian/K-5488-2019; Chen, Zhong/G-4601-2010; wang, ruifang/D-3037-2016; Gao, Jinhao/F-5092-2010","Ni, Kaiyuan/0000-0002-8152-6746; Chen, Xiaoyuan/0000-0002-9622-0870; wang, ruifang/0000-0002-8456-9776; Gao, Jinhao/0000-0003-3215-7013; Wang, Zhenyu/0000-0003-0036-8000; chen, zhong/0000-0002-1473-2224",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,,AUG,2013,4,,,,,,,,2266,10.1038/ncomms3266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3266,,,,,,,,23903002,,,,,WOS:000323751200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, amine-terminated generation 5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5.NH2) modified with Gd(III) chelator, polyethylene glycol (PEG) monomethyl ether, and PEGylated FA were used as templates to entrap gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Further chelation of Gd(III) ions and acetylation of the remaining dendrimer terminal amines led to the formation of multifunctional FA-targeted Au DENPs loaded with Gd(III) (Gd-Au DENPs-FA). The formed Gd Au DENPs-FA probes were characterized via different techniques. We show that the Gd Au DENPs-FA probes with an Au NP core size of 4.0 nm are water dispersible, stable under different pH and temperature conditions, and cytocompatible in the given concentration range. With the co-existence of AuNPs and Gd(III) ions within the single multifunctional particles, Gd Au DENPs-FA displayed high X-ray attenuation intensity and reasonable r(1) relaxivity. These properties of the particles enabled them to be used as dual mode nanoprobes for targeted CT/MR imaging of cancer cells in vitro and xenograft tumor model in vivo via FA receptor-mediated active targeting pathway. The strategy to design multifunctional nanoprobes using the versatile dendrimer nanotechnology may be extended to design various dual mode or multimode imaging agents for accurate diagnosis of different types of cancer.

At present, controversial proof has been provided on the actual importance of surface functionalization of nanoparticles to improve their in vivo localization at the tumor. In the present paper, we have designed and developed a set of multifunctional nanoprobes, modified with three different variants of a model antibody, that is, the humanized monocolonal antibody trastuzumab (TZ), able to selectively target the HER2 receptor in breast cancer cells. Assuming that nanoparticle accumulation in target cells is strictly related to their physicochemical properties, we performed a comparative study of internalization, trafficking, and metabolism in MCF7 cells of multifunctional nanoparticles (MNP) functionalized with TZ or with alternative lower molecular weight variants of the monoclonal antibody, such as the half-chain (HC) and scFv fragments (scFv). Hence, to estimate to what extent the structure of the surface bioligand affects the targeting efficiency of the nanoconjugate, three cognate nanoconstructs were designed, in which only the antibody form was differentiated while the nanoparticle core was maintained unvaried, consisting of an iron oxide spherical nanocrystal coated with an amphiphilic polymer shell. In vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo analyses of the targeting efficiency and of the intracellular fate of MNP-TZ, MNP-HC, and MNP-scFv suggested that the highly stable MNP-HC is the best candidate for application in breast cancer detection.

Moreover, the USPIO confinement within the DPN porous structure is responsible for a significant enhancement in MRI relaxivity (r(2) similar to 500 (mMs)(-1)), up to similar to 5 times larger than commercially available systems.

With the hypothesis that aggregation of NPs stimulated by tumor microenvironment can be utilized to enhance retention and cellular uptake of NPs in tumors, we designed a smart NP system to evaluate the effect of aggregation on NPs' accumulation in tumor tissue. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, similar to 16 nm) were facilely prepared by surface modification with mixed-charge zwitterionic self-assembled monolayers, which can be stable at the pH of blood and normal tissues but aggregate instantly in response to the acidic extracellular pH of solid tumors. The zwitterionic AuNPs exhibited fast, ultrasensitive, and reversible response to the pH change from pH 7.4 to pH 6.5, which enabled the AuNPs to be well dispersed at pH 7.4 with excellent stealth ability to resist uptake by macrophages, while quickly aggregating at pH 63, leading to greatly enhanced uptake by cancer cells. An in vivo study demonstrated that the zwitterionic AuNPs had a considerable blood half-life with much higher tumor accumulation, retention, and cellular internalization than nonsensitive PEGylated AuNPs. A preliminary photothermal tumor ablation evaluation suggested the aggregation of AuNPs can be applied to cancer NIR photothermal therapy.

Poor response rates and survival with current treatments clearly indicate the urgent need for developing an effective means to treat NSCLC. Magnetic hyperthermia is a non-invasive approach for tumor ablation, and is based on heat generation by magnetic materials, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles, when subjected to an alternating magnetic field. However, inadequate delivery of magnetic nanoparticles to tumor cells can result in sub-lethal temperature change and induce resistance while non-targeted delivery of these particles to the healthy tissues can result in toxicity. In our studies, we evaluated the effectiveness of tumor-targeted SPIO nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia of lung cancer. EGFR-targeted, inhalable SPIO nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized for targeting lung tumor cells as well as for magnetic hyperthermia-mediated antitumor efficacy in a mouse orthotopic model of NSCLC. Our results show that EGFR targeting enhances tumor retention of SPIO nanoparticles. Further, magnetic hyperthermia treatment using targeted SPIO nanoparticles resulted in significant inhibition of in vivo lung tumor growth.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is highly expressed in beta cells and considered as a promising target. We here developed a targeted superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle using GLP-1 analog-exendin-4 which is conjugated to polyethylene glycol coated SPIO (PEG-SPIO). The results demonstrated that exendin-4 functionalized SPIO was able to specifically bind to and internalized by GLP-1R-expressing INS-1 cells, with the higher labeling efficiency than non-targeted nanoparticles. Notably, SPIO-exendin4 could differentially label islets in pancreatic slices or beta cell grafts in vitro. Systemic delivery of SPIO-exendin4 into nude mice bearing s.c. insulinomas (derived from INS-1 cells) leads to the accumulation of the nanoparticles in tumors, generating a strong magnetic resonance imaging contrast detectable by a clinical MRI scanner at field strength of 3.0 T, and the iron deposition in tumors was further confirmed by Prussian blue staining. Furthermore, preliminary biodistribution study indicated that SPIO-exendin4 had a tendency to accumulate in pancreas. Toxicity assessments demonstrated good biocompatibility in vivo.

The doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded magnetic polymersomes were first attained by the self-assembly of lipid-containing copolymer, poly(acrylic acid-co-distearin acrylate), in aqueous solution containing citric acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), and followed by DOX loading via electrostatic attraction. To further functionalize these artificial vesicles with superior in vivo colloidal stability, pH-tunable drug release and active tumor-targeting, chitosan and poly(gamma-glutamic acid-co-gamma-glutamyl oxysuccinimide)-g-poly(ethyleneglycol)-folate (FA) were deposited in sequence onto the assembly outer surfaces. The interfacial nanogel layers via complementary electrostatic interactions and in-situ covalent cross-linking were thus produced. These nanogel-caged polymersomes (NCPs) show excellent anti-dilution and serumproteins-repellent behaviors. Triggerable release of the encapsulated DOX was governed by dual external stimuli, pH and temperature. When these theranostic NCPs were effectively internalized by HeLa cells via FA receptor-mediated endocytosis and then exposed to high frequency magnetic fields (HFMF), the combined effects of both pH and magnetic hyperthermia-triggered drug release and thermo-therapy resulted in greater cytotoxicity than the treatment by DOX alone. By virtue of the SPION clustering effect in the assembly inner aqueous compartments, the SPION/DOX-loaded NCPs displayed an r(2) relaxivity value (255.2 Fe mM(-1) S-1) higher than Resovist (183.4 Fe mM(-1) S-1), a commercial SPION-based T-2 contrast agent.

However, free amine groups designed for the coupling can cause nonspecific binding of the imaging agents. We report here development of a nanocarrier, MnMEIO-silane-NH2-mPEG nanoparticles (NPs), consisting of a manganese-doped iron oxide nanoparticle core (MnMEIO), a copolymer shell of silane and amine-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (silane-EA-mPEG). The key feature in MnMEIO-silane-NH2-mPEG is the flexible PEG, which masks the non-conjugated reactive amine groups (-NH2 <-> -NH3+) and reduces nonspecific binding of MnMEIO-silane-NH2-mPEG to cells. The amine groups on MnMEIO-silane-NH2-mPEG were conjugated with the fluorescent dye, Cy777 or antibodies [Erbitux (Erb)] to form a MR-optical imaging contrast agent (MnMEIO-silane-NH2-(Erb)-mPEG) for EGFR-expressing tumors. Confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analyses showed that MnMEIO-silane-NH2-(Erb)-mPEG displayed low nonspecific binding. Moreover, TEM images showed that MnMEIO-silane-NH2-(Erb)-mPEG were endocytosed by EGFR-expressing cells. In line with their EGFR expression levels, A431, PC-3, and Colo-205 tumors treated with MnMEIO-silane-NH2-(Erb)-mPEG NPs showed -97.1%, -49.7%, and -2.8% contrast enhancement, respectively, in in vitro T-2-weighted MR imaging. In vivo T-2-weighted MR imaging and optical images showed that MnMEIO-silane-NH2-(Erb)mPEG could specifically and effectively target to EGFR-expressing tumors in nude mice; the relative contrast enhancements were 7.94 (at 2 h) and 7.59 (at 24 h) fold higher in A431 tumors as compared to the EGFR-negative Colo-205 tumors. On the contrary, MnMEIO-silane-NH2-(Erb) NPs showed only 1.44 (at 2 h) and 1.52 (at 24 h) fold higher in EGFR-positive tumors as compared to the EGFR-negative tumors. Finally, antibodies can be readily changed to allow imaging of other tumors bearing different antigens. These data indicate that masking surface charges on contrast agents is a useful strategy to improve imaging efficacy. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Properly tuning the plasmonic wavelength for photothermal therapy typically results in the nanostructure size reaching similar to 100 nm. We report a new combination cancer therapy platform that consists of relatively small 10 nm pH-responsive spherical gold nanoparticles and conjugated doxorubicins. They are designed to form aggregates in mild acidic environment such as in a tumor. The aggregates serve as a photothermal agent that can selectively exploit external light by their collective plasmon modes. Simultaneously, the conjugated doxorubicins are released. The spatiotemporal concertion is confirmed at the subcellular, cellular, and organ levels. Both agents colocalize in the cell nuclei. The conjugates accumulate in cancer cells by the rapid phagocytic actions and effective blockage of exocytosis by the increased aggregate size. They also effectively accumulate in tumors up to 17 times over the control because of the enhanced permeation and retention. The conjugates exhibit a synergistic effect enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude in cellular level. The synergistic effect is demonstrated by the remarkable reductions in both the therapeutically effective drug dosage and the photothermal laser threshold. Using an animal model, effective tumor growth suppression is demonstrated. The conjugates induce apoptosis to tumors without any noticeable damage to other organs.

In vitro and in vivo investigations revealed that the Fe3O4/MnO dumbbell-shaped nanocrystal exerted a negative T-2 contrast effect in its intact form and also gave rise to a positive contrast effect in T-1-weighted MR imaging by releasing Mn2+ ions in a low pH environment. This induced organ-specific contrast enhancement for both T-1- and T-2-weighted in vivo MR imaging.

In this work, we co-encapsulated iron oxide nanoparticles and chemotherapeutic drug into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microbubbles to form multifunctional polymer microbubbles (MPMBs) for both tumor lymph node imaging and therapy. Fe3O4 nanoparticles and doxorubicin (DOX) co-encapsulated PLGA microbubbles were prepared and filled with perfluorocarbon gas. Enhancement of ultrasound (US)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and US triggered drug delivery were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The MPMBs exhibited characters like narrow size distribution and smooth surface with a mean diameter of 868.0 +/- 68.73 nm. In addition, varying the concentration of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the bubbles did not significantly influence the DOX encapsulation efficiency or drug loading efficiency. Our in vitro results demonstrated that these MPMBs could enhance both US and MR imaging which was further validated in vivo showing that these MPMBs enhanced tumor lymph nodes signals. The anti-tumor effect of MPMBs mediated chemotherapy was assessed in vivo using end markers like tumor proliferation index, micro blood vessel density and micro lymphatic vessel density, which were shown consistently the lowest after the MPMBs plus sonication treatment compared to controls. In line with these findings, the tumor cell apoptotic index was found the largest after the MPMBs plus sonication treatment. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a doxorubicin loaded superparamagnetic PLGA-Iron Oxide multifunctional theranostic agent for dual-mode US/MR Imaging of lymph node, and for low frequency US triggered therapy of metastasis in lymph nodes, which might provide a strategy for the imaging and chemotherapy of primary tumor and their metastases.

Herein we compare the in vitro and In vivo capabilities of Au nanohexapods as photothermal transducers for theranostic applications by benchmarking against those of Au nanorods and nanocages. While all these Au nanostructures could absorb and convert near-infrared light into heat, Au nanohexapods exhibited the highest cellular uptake and the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro for both the as-prepared and PEGylated nanostructures. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that the PEGylated Au nanohexapods had significant blood circulation and tumor accumulation in a mouse breast cancer model. Following photothermal treatment, substantial heat was produced in situ and the tumor metabolism was greatly reduced for all these Au nanostructures, as determined with F-18-flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET/CT).

The Pgp siRNA selection from among a series of drug resistance targets was achieved by performing high throughput screening in a MDR breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/MDR. Following the establishment of a MCF-7/MDR xenograft model in nude mice, we demonstrated that a 50 nm MSNP, functionalized by a polyethyleneimine polyethylene glycol (PEI-PEG) copolymer, provides protected delivery of stably bound Dot and Pgp siRNA to the tumor site. The effective biodistribution and reduced reticuloendothelial uptake, as a result of our nanocarrier design, allowed us to achieve an 8% enhanced permeability and retention effect at the tumor site. Compared to free Dox or the carrier loaded with either drug or siRNA alone, the dual delivery system resulted in synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Analysis of multiple xenograft biopsies demonstrated significant Pgp knockdown at heterogeneous tumor sites that correspond to the regions where Dox was released intracellularly and induced apoptosis. We emphasize that the heterogeneity originates in the tumor microenvironment, which influences the vascular access, rather than heterogeneous Pgp expression in the MDR cells. Taken together, these data provide proof-of-principle testing of the use of a dual drug/siRNA nanocarrier to overcome Dox resistance in a xenograft.

Traditional imaging techniques are often limited by shallow penetration, low sensitivity, low specificity, poor spatial resolution or the use of ionizing radiation. Hybrid modalities, like optoacoustic imaging, an emerging molecular imaging modality, contribute to improving most of these limitations. However, this imaging method is hindered by relatively low signal contrast. Here, gold nanoprisms (AuNPrs) are used as signal amplifiers in multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to visualize gastrointestinal cancer. PEGylated AuNPrs are successfully internalized by HT-29 gastrointestinal cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, the particles show good biocompatibility and exhibit a surface plasmon band centered at 830 nm, a suitable wavelength for optoacoustic imaging purposes. These findings extend well to an in vivo setting, in which mice are injected with PEGylated AuNPrs in order to visualize tumor angiogenesis in gastrointestinal cancer cells. Overall, both our in vitro and in vivo results show that PEGylated AuNPrs have the capacity to penetrate tumors and provide a high-resolution signal amplifier for optoacoustic imaging.

In this study, we described a magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs)-based, polyelectrolyte (polyethylenimine, PEI) and fusogenic peptide (KALA)-functionalized siRNA delivery system (denoted as M-MSN_siRNA@PEI-KALA), which was highly effective for initiating target gene silencing both in vitro and in vivo. The construction of this delivery system began with the encapsulation of siRNA within the mesopores of M-MSNs, followed by the coating of PEI on the external surface of siRNA-loaded M-MSNs and the chemical conjugation of KALA peptides. The as-prepared delivery vehicles, with notable siRNA protective effect and negligible cytotoxicity, could be easily internalized into cells, readily escape from the endolysosomes and release the loaded siRNA into the cytoplasm. As a result, the knockdown of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor cells were observed, both with excellent RNAi efficiencies. In the following in vivo experiments, the intratumoral injection of M-MSN_VEGF siRNA@PEI-KALA significantly inhibited the tumor growth, possibly by the suppression of neovascularization in tumors. To sum up, we have established a highly effective MSNs-based delivery system, which has great potential to serve as therapeutic siRNA formulation for cancer treatment.

For these prerequisites, cationic polymer-mesoporous silica nanoparticles (ssCP-MSNs) were prepared by surface functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles with disulfide bond cross-linked poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA). In vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed. The synthesized ssCP-MSNs are 100-150 nm in diameter with a pore size of 10 nm and a positively charged surface with a high zeta potential of 27 mV. Consequently, the ssCP-MSNs showed an excellent binding capacity for siRNA, and an enhancement in the cell uptake and cytosolic availability of siRNA. Furthermore, the intracellular reducing cleavage of the disulfide bonds cross-linking the PDMAEMA segments led to intracellular cleavage of PDMAEMA from ssCP-MSNs, which facilitated the intracellular triggered release of siRNA. Therefore, promoted RNA interference was observed in HeLa-Luc cells, which was equal to that of Lipofectamine 2000. Significantly, compared to Lipofectamine 2000, the ssCP-MSNs were more biocompatible, with low cytotoxicity (even non-cytotoxicity) and promotion of cell proliferation to HeLa-Luc cells. The in vivo systemic distribution studies certified that ssCP-MSNs/siRNA could prolong the duration of siRNA in vivo, and that they accumulated in the adrenal gland, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, heart and thymus after intravenous injection.

In pMMUS imaging, a high intensity pulsed magnetic field is used to excite cells or tissue labeled with magnetic nanoparticles. Then, ultrasound (US) imaging is used to monitor the mechanical response of the tissue to an externally applied magnetic field (i.e., tissue displacement). Signal to noise ratio (SNR) in pMMUS imaging can be improved by using superparamagnetic nanoparticles with larger saturation magnetization. Metal-doped magnetic nanoparticles with enhanced tunable nanomagnetism are suitable candidates to improve the SNR and, therefore, sensitivity of pMMUS imaging, which is essential for in vivo pMMUS imaging.

In this study, we created a plasmid, pACTERT-TRAIL, which used the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter, a tumor-specific promoter, to drive tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). A Fe3O4-PEI-plasmid complex (FPP) was generated, in which the iron oxide nanoparticles were modified by positively charged polyethylenimine (PEI) to enable them to carry the negatively charged plasmid. In vitro transfection assays showed that efficiency of magnetofection (i.e., FPP transfection) was sixfold higher compared to PEI alone or Lipofectamine 2000 (hereafter referred to as lipofectin) (P < 0.05). Importantly, apoptotic assays demonstrated that FPP-mediated TRAIL gene transfer could efficiently induce apoptosis of SACC-83 cells in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that magnetofection of the plasmids driven by the tumor-specific promoter hTERT provides an effective way to deliver therapeutic genes for the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the future. From the Clinical Editor: In this novel study addressing adenoid cystic carcinoma, the authors created a plasmid to drive tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Following that, a Fe3O4-PEI-plasmid complex (FPP) was generated, in which the iron oxide nanoparticles were modified by positively charged polyethylenimine (PEI) enabling them to carry the negatively charged plasmid, giving rise to sixfold higher transfection rates compared to standard technology.

In this work, a novel promising hyperthermia agent employing magnetic Fe3O4 particles with fairly low toxicity was proposed. This hyperthermia agent showed rapid heat generation under NIR irradiation. After modification with carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTS), the obtained Fe3O4@CMCTS particles could disperse stably in PBS and serum without any aggregation. The modification of CMCTS could decrease the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and improve the cellular uptake. In a comparative study with hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS), Fe3O4@ CMCTS particles exhibited a comparable photothermal effect and fairly low cytotoxicity. The in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) images of mice revealed that by attaching a magnet to the tumor, Fe3O4@CMCTS particles accumulated in the tumor after intravenous injection and showed a low distribution in the liver. After being exposed to a 808 nm laser for 5 min at a low power density of 1.5 W cm(-2), the tumors on Fe3O4@CMCTS-injected mice reached a temperature of similar to 52 degrees C and were completely destroyed.

The formed Au DENPs-FA was used for both in vitro and in vivo targeted CT imaging of human lung adencarcinoma cells (SPC-A1 cells) and the xenograft tumor model, which express folic acid receptors (FAR) verified by immunohistochemical staining. Micro-CT images show that SPC-A1 cells can be detected under X-ray after incubation with the Au DENPs-FA in vitro and the xenograft tumor model can be imaged after intravenous, intratumoral, and intraperitoneal administration of the particles.

A variety of imaging modalities needs to be used from non-invasive, moderate resolution modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to very high-resolution (e.g. fluorescence) imaging that can help guide surgeons during a surgical operation. While MRI can have relatively high resolution and deep penetration to visualize soft tissues, low sensitivity of MRI frequently requires tumor imaging agents to enhance the MRI contrast at the tumor site. At the other end of the resolution spectrum, near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has very high sensitivity but frequently cannot be utilized for initial human in vivo imaging due to its very limited penetration depth. To combine the advantages of each imaging modality we have constructed MRI and NIRF dual-modality nanoparticles using glycol chitosan, Cy5.5, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs). We have demonstrated these advantages for dual-modality, in vivo tumor imaging in mice. Our studies suggest the potential use of NIRF and MR dual modality imaging for human cancer diagnosis.

Very recently, we developed a novel class of high-affinity (<100 nM) peptides, termed 'aptides', that specifically bind a variety of protein targets. Here, we describe superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) conjugated with EDB-specific aptides for use in targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cancer. An anti-EDB aptide (APT(EDB)) containing an additional cysteine residue reacted with maleimide-terminated, PEGylated phospholipid (Mal-PEG(2000)-DSPE) to give an aptide-conjugated PEGylated phospholipid (APT(EDB)-PEG(2000)-DSPE). A nanoemulsion method was then used to coat oleic acid-stabilized SPIONs with amphiphilic phospholipids, including APT(EDB)-PEG(2000)-DSPE, methoxy-PEG(2000)-DSPE, and rhodamine-DMPE. The resulting nanoparticles (APT(EDB)-SPIONs) had a hydrodynamic size of less than 50 nm and remained stable in an aqueous solution for at least 1 week. In in vitro studies, APT(EDB)-SPIONs showed specific uptake by EDB-overexpressing cell lines. In an in vivo Lewis lung carcinoma model that expresses a high level of the target EDB protein, MRI clearly revealed that APT(EDB)-SPIONs injected via the tail vein specifically accumulated at the tumor site. Non-targeting SPIONs lacking the anti-EDB aptide showed much lower uptake in tumor tissues than did aptide-conjugated nanoparticles. Further, we confirmed that the distribution of nanoparticles within the tumor tissue was well correlated with the areas where EDB was expressed. Our APT(EDB)-SPIONs hold high potential as a specific imaging modality for the detection of EDB-overexpressing tumors. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The manganese oxide-based multifunctionalization of hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles was achieved by an in situ redox reaction using mesopores as the nanoreactors. Due to the dissolution nature of manganese oxide nanoparticles under weak acidic conditions, the relaxation rate r(1) of manganese-based mesoporous MRI-T-1 contrast agents (CAs) could reach 8.81 mM(-1)s(-1), which is a 11-fold magnitude increase compared to the neutral condition, and is almost two times higher than commercial Gd-III-based complex agents. This is also the highest r(1) value ever reported for manganese oxide nanoparticles-based MRI-T-1 CAs. In addition, the hollow interiors and thin mesoporous silica shells endow HMCNs with the functions of CAs for efficient in vitro and in vivo ultrasonography under both harmonic- and B-modes. Importantly, the well-defined mesopores and large hollow interiors of HMCNs could encapsulate and deliver anticancer agents (doxorubicin) intracellularly to circumvent the multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells and restore the anti-proliferative effect of drugs by nanoparticle-mediated endocytosis process, intracellular drug release and P-gp inhibition/ATP depletion in cancer cells.

Owing to their intrinsic optical, electrical and magnetic properties, nanoparticles are promising contrast agents for imaging dynamic molecular and cellular processes such as protein-protein interactions, enzyme activity or gene expression(2). Until now, nanoparticles have been engineered with targeting ligands such as antibodies and peptides to improve tumour specificity and uptake. However, excessive loading of ligands can reduce the targeting capabilities of the ligand(3-5) and reduce the ability of the nanoparticle to bind to a finite number of receptors on cells(6). Increasing the number of nanoparticles delivered to cells by each targeting molecule would lead to higher signal-to-noise ratios and would improve image contrast. Here, we show that M13 filamentous bacteriophage can be used as a scaffold to display targeting ligands and multiple nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging of cancer cells and tumours in mice. Monodisperse iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles assemble along the M13 coat, and its distal end is engineered to display a peptide that targets SPARC glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Compared with nanoparticles that are directly functionalized with targeting peptides, our approach improves contrast because each SPARC-targeting molecule delivers a large number of nanoparticles into the cells. Moreover, the targeting ligand and nanoparticles could be easily exchanged for others, making this platform attractive for in vivo high-throughput screening and molecular detection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1748-3387,1748-3395,,,,OCT,2012,7,10,,,,,677,682,,10.1038/NNANO.2012.146,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NNANO.2012.146,,,,,,,,22983492,,,,,WOS:000309675000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

To tackle these challenges, we designed a nanoparticle for vascular targeting based on an alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-targeted nanochain particle composed of four iron oxide nanospheres chemically linked in a linear assembly. The chain-shaped nanoparticles enabled enhanced sensing of the tumor-associated remodeling of the vascular bed, offering increased likelihood of specific recognition of metastatic tumors.

In this study, we prepared an iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP)-loaded, functional nano-carrier with different loading contents to modulate the mechanical properties of the system, and compared the characteristics of tumor targeting and imaging in terms of loading contents of IONP. As a functional nano-carrier, chitosan-conjugated, Pluronic-based nano-carrier with useful properties such as long blood circulation, good tumor targeting, and easy loading of macromolecules was used. IONPs were efficiently encapsulated into the nano-carrier (high loading efficiency over 95%) and the mechanical properties of the IONP-loaded nano-carrier were controlled by varying the loading amount of IONP. The IONP-loaded nano-carrier with the higher loading content of IONP (40 wt.%) was significantly more rigid (over 2x) than those with lower loading contents of IONP (5 and 15 wt.%). Although the nano-carrier with the higher loading content of IONP showed more enhanced MR contrast effect with higher T-2 relaxivity and higher intracellular uptake in vitro, characteristics of in-vivo tumor targeting and MR cancer imaging were not good compared to that of the nano-carrrier with the lower loading contents of IONP. Since different loading contents did not affect other characteristics of the system (size, surface chemistry, and surface charge), the present result suggests that the mechanical properties (strength/flexibility) of nano-systems are also important factors to be controlled for targeted delivery and imaging.

In vitro results show that all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can cause a significant decrease in cancer cell survival after gamma radiation. 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have dispersive distributions in the cells and stronger sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles by both cell apoptosis and necrosis.

However, complete eradication of tumor cells with PTA is difficult because of uneven heat distribution in the treatment volume. We hypothesized that combining PTA with chemotherapy using a single multifunctional nanoconstruct that mediates simultaneous photothermal cell killing and drug release (photothermal-chemotherapy) would result in enhanced antitumor activity and reduced toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded to hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNS) coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of both DOX and HAuNS in the resulting nanoconstruct, DOX@PEG-HAuNS having different DOX: PEG: HAuNS ratios, were evaluated using dual isotope labeling techniques. The antitumor activity of DOX@PEG-HAuNS with DOX: PEG: HAuNS weight ratio of 1:3:1 (NP3) in combination with NIR laser was studied in vitro and in vivo using human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and A2780 ovarian cancer cells. In vitro, NP3 mediated PTA of both cancer cells and DOX release upon NIR laser treatment. In vivo, NP3 showed slower clearance in blood and greater accumulation in tumors than free DOX. NP3-plus-NIR laser demonstrated greater antitumor activity than free DOX, NP3, or liposomal DOX. Moreover, NP3 displayed significantly decreased systemic toxicity compared to free DOX or liposomal DOX. Enhanced antitumor effect with NP3-plus-laser can be attributed to both the cytotoxic effect of DOX released from NP3 and the photothermal effect mediated by HAuNS. Slow release of DOX from NP3 in normal tissues contributed to reduced systemic toxicity. Photothermal-chemotherapy exemplified by a single-agent nanoconstruct NP3 is a promising approach to anticancer therapy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Significant tumor-suppression effects were achieved with camptothecin-loaded MSNs. Dramatic improvement of the potency of tumor suppression was obtained by surface modifying MSNs with folic acid. Dose-dependent tumor suppression was observed, establishing 0.5 mg of CPT-loaded MSNs per mouse as a minimum dose sufficient for achieving complete tumor growth inhibition.

In this study, amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimers of generation 5 (G5.NH2) modified by PEG monomethyl ether (G5.NH2-mPEG(20)) were used as templates to synthesize Au DENPs, followed by acetylation of the remaining dendrimer terminal amines to generate PEGylated Au DENPs. The partial PEGylation modification of dendrimer terminal amines allows high loading of Au within the dendrimer interior, and consequently by simply varying the Au salt/dendrimer molar ratio, the size of the PEGylated Au DENPs can be controlled at a range of 2-4 nm with a narrow size distribution. The formed PEGylated Au DENPs are water-dispersible, stable in a pH range of 5-8 and a temperature range of 0-50 degrees C, and non-cytotoxic at a concentration as high as 100 mu m. X-ray absorption coefficient measurements show that the attenuation intensity of the PEGylated Au DENPs is much higher than that of Omnipaque with iodine concentration similar to Au. With the sufficiently long half-decay time demonstrated by pharmacokinetics studies, the PEGylated Au DENPs enabled not only X-ray CT blood pool imaging of mice and rats after intravenous injection of the particles, but also effective CT imaging of a xenograft tumor model in nude mice.

However, DOX-FA-SNs showed lower cytotoxicity in folate receptor negative normal mouse fibroblast cells (L929 cells) compared with free DOX. In vivo tumor-targeted fluorescence imaging indicated specific tumor targeting and uptake of FA-SNs in nude mice bearing subcutaneous HeLa cell-derived xenograft tumors. In vivo anti-tumor experiments demonstrated that DOX-FA-SNs (10 mg kg(-1) of DOX) significantly regressed the tumor growth and reduced toxicity compared with free DOX.

The obtained material is highly stable in plasma, with low release of the cargo at physiological pH. Cell internalization and in vitro efficacy assays demonstrated that nanoparticles carrying CPT (SNP-CPT) entered cells via endocytosis and the intracellular release of the cargo induced cell death with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and cell cycle distribution profiles similar to those observed for the naked drug. Further, in vivo biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy and biocompatibility of the SNP-CPT were evaluated in human colorectal cancer xenografts using in vivo fluorescence or bioluminescence optical imaging. In vivo tumor-accumulation and whole-body tissue distribution were carried out based on the acquisition of fluorescence emission of a fluorophore (Cy5.5) conjugated to the SNP-CPT, as well as by HPLC quantification of tissue CPT levels. The results showed that, although SNP-CPT tended to accumulate in organs of the reticuloendothelial system, nanoparticles boost CPT concentration in tumor vs administration of the free drug. Accordingly, SNP-CPT treatment delayed the growth of subcutaneous tumors while significantly reducing the systemic toxicity associated with CPT administration.

In this study, multifunctional superparamagnetic iron oxide coated with gold nanoshell (SPIO@Au NS) that have both optical and magnetic properties was conjugated with the targeting agent, C225 monoclonal antibody, against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). C225-SPIO@Au NS have an average a diameter of 82 +/- 4.4 nm, contain 142 +/- 15 antibodies per nanoshell, have an absorption peak in the near infrared (similar to 800 nm), and have transverse relaxivity (r(2)) of 193 and 353 mM(-1) s(-1) versus Feridex (TM) of 171 and 300 mM(-1) s(-1), using 1.5 T and 71 MR scanners, respectively. Specific targeting of the synthesized C225-SPIO@Au NS was tested in vitro using A431 cells and oral cancer cells, FaDu, OSC19, and HN5, all of which overexpress EGFR. Selective binding was achieved using C225-SPIO@Au NS but not with the non-targeting PEG-SPIO@Au NS and blocking group (excess of C225 + C225-SPIO@Au NS). In vivo biodistribution on mice bearing A431 tumors also showed selective targeting of C225-SPIO@Au NS compared with the non-targeting and blocking groups. The selective photothermal ablation of the nanoshells shows that without laser treatment there were no cell death and among the groups that were treated with laser at a power of 36 W/cm(2) for 3 min, only the cells treated with C225-SPIO@Au NS had cell killing (p < 0.001). In summary, successful synthesis and characterization of targeted C225-SPIO@Au NS demonstrating both superparamagnetic and optical properties has been achieved. We have shown both in vitro and in vivo that these nanoshells are MR-active and can be selectively heated up for simultaneous imaging and photothermal ablation therapy.

Here we investigate the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 NPs with DNR on the induction of apoptosis using K562 leukemia cells. Fe3O4 NPs increased the ability of DNR to induce apoptosis in both adriamycin-sensitive and adriamycin-resistant K562 cells through the caspase 8-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase pathway. Fe3O4 NPs combined with DNR also effectively inhibited the tumor growth induced by the inoculation of K562 cells into nude mice. The increased cell apoptotic rate was closely correlated with the enhanced inhibition of tumor growth. Biodistribution studies in xenograft tumors indicated that Fe3O4 NPs could be potentially excreted from the body via the gastrointestinal system. In conclusion, our study suggests that Fe3O4 NPs combined with anticancer drugs could serve as a better alternative for targeted therapeutic approaches to cancer treatments.

In vivo experiments proved that the burdened MSCs can track down the U251 glioma tumor cells more efficiently and deliver doxorubicin with wider distribution and longer retention lifetime in tumor tissues compared with free DOX and silica nanorattle-encapsulated DOX.

Herein, a highly magnetic nanocarrier (HMNC) composed of an Fe3O4 core and an aqueous-stable, self-doped poly[N-(1-one-butyric acid)]aniline (SPAnH) shell was chemically synthesized. This nanocarrier exhibited a high capacity for 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) drug loading. BCNU and o-(2-aminoethyl)polyethylene glycol (EPEG) were covalently immobilized on the surface of the HMNC to form a self-protecting magnetic nanomedicine (i.e., SPMNM) that could simultaneously provide low reticuloendothelial system uptake, high active-targeting, and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) traceability. Meanwhile, the SPMNM was found to reduce the phagocytosis by macrophages and reduce the hydrolysis rate of BCNU. The high magnetization (approximately 1.2-fold higher than Resovist) of the HMNC allowed efficient magnetic targeting to the tumor. The synergetic drug delivery approach provided approximately a 3.4-fold improvement of the drug's half-life (from 18 h to 62 h) and significantly prolonged the median survival rate in animals that received a low dose of BCNU, compared with those that received a high dose of free BCNU (63 days for those that received 4.5 mg BCNU/kg carried by the nanocarrier versus 50 days for those that received 13.5 mg of free-BCNU). This improvement could enhance the potential of magnetic targeting therapy in clinical applications of cancer treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Leukemia is a cancer of the hematological system and can be divided into a diversity of unique malignancies based on the onset of the disease as well as the specific cell lineages involved. Cancer stem cells, including recently identified leukemia stem cells (LSCs), are hypothesized to be responsible for cancer development, relapse, and resistance to treatment, and new therapeutics targeting these cellular populations are urgently needed. Nontoxic and nonaggregating: calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) encapsulating the near-infrared fluoroprobe indocyanine green (ICG) were recently developed for diagnostic imaging and drug delivery as well as for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of solid tumors. Prior studies revealed that specific targeting of CPSNPs allowed for enhanced accumulation within breast cancer tumors, via CD71 targeting, or pancreatic cancer tumors, via gastrin receptor targeting. In the present study, ICG-loaded CPSNPs were evaluated as photosensitizers for PDT of leukemia. Using a novel bioconjugation approach to specifically target CD117 or CD96, surface features enhanced on leukemia stem cells, in vitro ICG-CPSNP PDT of a marine leukemia cell line and human leukemia samples were dramatically improved. Furthermore, the in vivo efficacy of PDT was dramatically enhanced in a murine leukemia model by utilizing CD117-targeted ICG-CPSNPs, resulting in 29% disease-free survival.

The SiO(2) HNPs are fabricated using a one-step, one-medium process which obviates the need for post-treatment to remove the templates, additional dissolution, or calcination. Taking advantage of the cross-linking reaction with (3-Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GTPMS), cationic polysaccharide-chitosan decorates the surface and produces pH sensitive CS-SiO(2) HNPs. The materials enable controlled release of loaded drugs in pericellular and interstitial environments. In particular, the antibody molecule (to ErbB 2) can be conjugated onto the surface of the CS-SiO(2) HNPs thereby allowing the hollow nanospheres to serve as a targeted delivery agent to breast cancer cells. TNF-alpha are delivered to MCF-7 breast cancer cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions to suppress the growth of cancerous cells and even kill them with high therapeutic efficacy.

In this study, superparamagnetic silica-coated iron oxide core-shell nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs) with a diameter of approximately 21 nm were synthesized via a thermal decomposition approach and were aminated through silanization. The amine-functionalized Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs enabled the covalent conjugation of a paramagnetic gadolinium complex (Gd-DTPA, DTPA: diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) and an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide as a targeting ligand onto their surface. The formed Fe3O4@SiO2(Gd-DTPA)-RGD NPs are water-dispersible, stable, and biocompatible as confirmed by MTT cell viability assay. Relaxivity measurements show that they have a T-1 relaxivity (r(1)) of 4.2 mM(-1) s(-1) and T-2 relaxivity (r(2)) of 17.4 mM(-1) s(-1) at the Gd/Fe molar ratio of 0.3:1, suggesting a possibility to use them as both T-1 positive and T-2 negative contrast agents.

The QDs and IOs-loaded PLA-TPGS NPs were prepared by a modified nanoprecipitation method, which were then characterized for their size and size distribution, zeta potential and the imaging agent encapsulation efficiency. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed direct evidence for the well-dispersed distribution of the QDs and IOs within the PLA-TPGS NPs. The cellular uptake and the cytotoxicity of the PLA-TPGS NPs formulation of QDs and IOs were investigated in vitro with MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which were conducted in close comparison with the free QDs and IOs at the same agent dose. The Xenograft model was also conducted for biodistribution of the QDs and IOs-loaded PLA-TPGS NPs among the various organs, which showed greatly enhanced tumor imaging due to the passively targeting effects of the NPs to the tumor. Images of tumors were acquired in vivo by a 7T MRI scanner. Further ex vivo images of the tumors were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

This work aimed to develop a long-circulating magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (MNP) platform capable of sustained tumor exposure via the circulation and, thus, potentially enhanced magnetic tumor targeting. Aminated, cross-linked starch (DN) and aminosilane (A) coated MNPs were successfully modified with 5 kDa (A5, D5) or 20 kDa (A20. D20) polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains using simple N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry and characterized. Identical PEG-weight analogues between platforms (A5 & D5, A20 & D20) were similar in size (140-190 nm) and relative PEG labeling (1.5% of surface amines - A5/D5, 0.4% - A20/D20), with all PEG MNPs possessing magnetization properties suitable for magnetic targeting. Candidate PEG MNPs were studied in RES simulations in vitro to predict long-circulating character. D5 and D20 performed best showing sustained size stability in cell culture medium at 37 degrees C and 7 (D20) to 10 (D5) fold less uptake in RAW264.7 macrophages when compared to previously targeted, unmodified starch MNPs (D). Observations in vitro were validated in vivo, with D5 (7.29 h) and 020 (11.75 h) showing much longer half-lives than D (0.12 h). Improved plasma stability enhanced tumor MNP exposure 100 (D5) to 150 (D20) fold as measured by plasma AUC(0-infinity). Sustained tumor exposure over 24 h was visually confirmed in a 9L-glioma rat model (12 mg Fe/kg) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The IC(50) of DMNs against MCF-7/ADR cells was 8-fold lower than that of free DOX. However, an improved effect of DOX in DMNs against MCF-7 cells (a DOX-sensitive cancer cell line) was not found. The increased cellular uptake and nuclear accumulation of DOX delivered by DMNs in MCF-7/ADR cells was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and could result from the down-regulation of P-gp and bypassing the efflux action by MSNs themselves. The cellular uptake mechanism of DMNs indicated that the macropinocytosis was one of the pathways for the uptake of DMNs by MCF-7/ADR cells.

Such biocompatible PVP-10s with different sizes were synthesized by a simple one-pot pyrolysis method. These PVP-10s exhibited good crystallinity and high T-2 relaxivities, and the relaxivity increased with the size of the magnetic nanopartides. It was found that cellular uptake changed with both size and surface physiochemical properties, and that PVP-10-37 with a core size of 37 nm and hydrodynamic particle size of 100 nm exhibited higher cellular uptake rate and greater distribution than other PVP-10s and Feridex. We systematically investigated the effect of nanoparticle size on MRI of normal liver and hepatic lesions in vivo. The physical and chemical properties of the nanoparticles influenced their pharmacokinetic behavior, which ultimately determined their ability to accumulate in the liver. The contrast enhancement of PVP-10s within the liver was highly dependent on the overall size of the nanopartides, and the 100 nm PVP-10-37 nanopartides exhibited the greatest enhancement.

They serve as carriers for the co-delivery of drug and gene nanoparticles via a multistage method for cancer therapy. With a porous structure, the mesocrystalline CaCO3 particles encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX), Au-DNA, and Fe3O4@silica nanoparticles for magnetic control and therapy. As stage 1 microparticles (S1MPs), the nanoparticles-CaCO3 system is designed to protect functional sections from degradation and phagocytosis in blood circulation. After the particle margination in vascular walls, the Au-DNA nanoparticles (stage 2 nanoparticles, S2NPs) and DOX are gradually released from S1MPs by degradation towards targeted tissues for biomedical therapy. The nanoparticles-CaCO3 system exhibits high efficiency of intracellular delivery, especially in nuclear invasion. The successful expression of reporter gene and intracellular transport of DOX in vitro suggest potential as a co-delivery system for drug and gene therapy. In a mouse tumor model, the system with particle margination and two-step strategy affords the protection of functional nanoparticles and drug from clearance and inactivation by enzymes and proteins in vivo. The targeted delivery of S2NPs into tumors by this system is tenfold more efficient than that of the nanoparticles themselves. The drug is observed to be widely distributed in tumor slices. Thus, this platform exhibits an efficient approach in the targeted delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles and molecules via a multistage strategy, and can be used as a potential system in co-delivery of multiple agents for biomedical imaging and therapy.",,,,,"Zhao, Yang/J-2690-2014; Yu, Shu-Hong/A-1903-2010; Lu, Yang/J-3493-2012","Yu, Shu-Hong/0000-0003-3732-1011; Lu, Yang/0000-0002-8412-809X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1613-6810,,,,,5-Nov,2010,6,21,,,,,2436,2442,,10.1002/smll.201000903,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201000903,,,,,,,,20878636,,,,,WOS:000284016700014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using both syngeneic mouse and human xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have demonstrated that a subpopulation enriched in cancer stem cells was more resistant to treatment with 6 gray of ionizing radiation than the bulk of the tumor cells, and accordingly their relative proportion increased 48 to 72 hours after ionizing radiation treatment. In contrast, we achieved a larger reduction in tumor size without a concomitant increase in the percentage of cancer stem cells by treating with local hyperthermia for 20 minutes at 42 C after ionizing radiation using intravenously administered, optically activated gold nanoshells. Forty-eight hours after treatment, cells derived from the tumors treated with ionizing radiation plus hyperthermia exhibited both a marked decrease in tumorigenicity and a more differentiated phenotype than mock- and ionizing radiation-treated tumors. Thus, we have confirmed that these cancer stem cells are responsible for accelerated repopulation in vivo and demonstrated that hyperthermia sensitizes this cell population to radiation treatment.

The synthetic strategy for the creation of huge cavities between functional core and mesoporous silica shell is based on a structural difference based selective etching method, by which solid silica middle layer of Fe2O3@SiO2@mSiO(2) (or Au@SiO2@mSiO(2)) composite nanostructures was selectively etched away while the mesoporous silica shell could be kept relatively intact. The excellent biocompatibility of obtained multifunctional nanocapsules (Fe3O4@mSiO(2)) was demonstrated by very low cytotoxicity against various cell lines, low hemolyticity against human blood red cells and no significant coagulation effect against blood plasma. The cancer cell uptake and intracellular location of the nanocapsules were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and bio-TEM. Importantly, the prepared multifunctional inorganic mesoporous nanocapsules show both high loading capacity (20%) and efficiency (up to 100%) for doxorubicin simultaneously because of the formation of the cavity, enhanced surface area/pore volume and the electrostatic interaction between DOX molecules and mesoporous silica surface. Besides, the capability of Fe3O4@mSiO(2) nanocapsules as contrast agents of MRI was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, indicating the simultaneous imaging and therapeutic multifunctionalities of the composite nanocapsules. Moreover, the concept of multifunctional inorganic nanocapsules was extended to design and prepare Gd-Si-DTPA grafted Au@mSiO(2) nanocapsules for nanomedical applications, further demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the preparation of various multifunctional mesoporous nanocapsules.",,,,,"Chen, Yu/N-8463-2015; Chen, Yu/E-9324-2012; Chen, Feng/O-2967-2013; Chen, Hangrong/I-3902-2012","Chen, Yu/0000-0002-8206-3325; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,,,,,OCT,2010,4,10,,,,,6001,6013,,10.1021/nn1015117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn1015117,,,,,,,,20815402,,,,,WOS:000283453700069,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have developed and evaluated plasmonic nanobubbles (PNBs) as an in vivo tunable theranostic cellular agent in zebrafish hosting prostate cancer xenografts. PNBs were selectively generated around gold nanoparticles in cancer cells in the zebrafish with short single laser pulses. By varying the energy of the laser pulse, we dynamically tuned the PNB size in a theranostic sequence of two PNBs: an initial small PNB detected a cancer cell through optical scattering, followed by a second bigger PNB, which mechanically ablated this cell without damage to surrounding tissue, while its optical scattering confirmed the destruction of the cell. Thus PNBs supported the diagnosis and guided ablation of individual human cancer cells in a living organism without damage to the host. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This carrier was specially designed in a core-shell structure. The core was achieved by utilizing a strategy of self-assembly of oppositely charged ultrafine superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles previously prepared. The final particles were formed by coating such cores with carboxymethyldextran (CMD) polymer. By exclusion of non-magnetic materials from the interior part of the particles, this structure maximized the amount of magnetic material and thus yielded a superior magnetophoretic mobility. Such a strategy avoids the challenge of superparamagnetism loss, which would be caused by cores exceeding a critical domain size. Coating the self-assembled core enables the magnetic carrier to be stable upon usage and storage and to be readily linked with drug molecules for therapeutic applications. In vitro characterization showed that these nanoparticles displayed a 3- to 4-fold enhancement in magnetophoretic mobility, and a markedly improved stability when stored in 50% serum as a comparison of conventional iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles.

Gum arabic glycoprotein (GA)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) possess optimum sizes (12-18 nm core diameter and 85 nm hydrodynamic diameter) to target individual tumor cells and penetrate through tumor vasculature and pores. We report the results of detailed in vivo therapeutic investigations demonstrating the high tumor affinity of GA-(198)AuNPs in severely compromised immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts. Intratumoral administration of a single dose of beta-emitting GA-(198)AuNPs (70 Gy) resulted in clinically significant tumor regression and effective control in the growth of prostate tumors over 30 days. Three weeks after administration of GA-(198)AuNPs, tumor volumes for the treated animals were 82% smaller as compared with tumor volume of control group. The treatment group showed only transitory weight loss in sharp contrast to the tumor-bearing control group, which underwent substantial weight loss. Pharmacokinetic studies have provided unequivocal evidence for the optimum retention of therapeutic payload of GA-(198)AuNPs within the tumor site throughout the treatment regimen with minimal or no leakage of radioactivity to various nontarget organs. The measurements of white and red blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes within the treatment group resembled those of the normal SCID mice, thus providing further evidence on the therapeutic efficacy and concomitant in vivo tolerance and nontoxic features of GA-(198)AuNPs. From the Clinical Editor: In this study, the biocompatibility and cancer therapeutic applications of glycoprotein (GA) functionalized gold nanoparticles containing b-emitting Au-198 are described in SCID mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts.

In the current study, we utilized dopamine to modify the surface of IONPs, yielding nanoconjugates that can be easily encapsulated into human serum albumin (HSA) matrices (clinically utilized drug carriers). This nanosystem is well-suited for dual encapsulation of IONPs and drug molecules, because the encapsulation is achieved in a way that is similar to common drug loading. To assess the biophysical characteristics of this novel nanosystem, the HSA coated IONPs (HSA-IONPs) were dually labeled with Cu-64-DOTA and Cy5.5, and tested in a subcutaneous U87MG xenograft mouse model. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tri-modality imaging, and ex vivo analyses and histological examinations were carefully conducted to investigate the in vivo behavior of the nanostructures.

The high rate of mortality is mainly attributed to the tendency for late diagnoses as symptoms may not occur until the disease has metastasized, as well as the lack of effective systemic therapies. Late diagnosis is often associated with the lack of timely sensitive imaging modalities. The promise of nanotechnology is presently limited by the inability to simultaneously seek, treat, and image cancerous lesions. This study describes the design and synthesis of fluorescent calcium phosphosilicate nanocomposite particles (CPNPs) that can be systemically targeted to breast and pancreatic cancer lesions. The CPNPs are a similar to 20 nm diameter composite composed of an amorphous calcium phosphate matrix doped with silicate in which a near-infrared imaging agent, indocyanine green (ICG), is embedded. In the present studies, we describe and validate CPNP bioconjugation of human holotransferrin, anti-CD71 antibody, and short gastrin peptides via an avidin-biotin or a novel PEG-maleimide coupling strategy. The conjugation of biotinylated human holotransferrin (diferric transferrin) and biotinylated anti-CD71 antibody (anti-transferrin receptor antibody) to avidin-conjugated CPNPs (Avidin-CPNPs) permits targeting of transferrin receptors, which are highly expressed on breast cancer cells. Similarly, the conjugation of biotinylated pentagastrin to Avidin-CPNPs and decagastrin (gastrin-10) to PEG-CPNPs via PEG-maleimide coupling permits targeting of gastrin receptors, which are overexpressed in pancreatic cancer lesions. These bioconjugated CPNPs have the potential to perform as a theranostic modality, simultaneously enhancing drug delivery, targeting, and imaging of breast and pancreatic cancer tumors.",,,,,"Altinoglu, Erhan I/A-9762-2010; Kester, Mark/ABG-4615-2020","Matters, Gail/0000-0001-8613-8649; Barth, Brian/0000-0002-3542-1804; Adair, James/0000-0002-7516-5024",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0851,1936-086X,,,,MAR,2010,4,3,,,,,1279,1287,,10.1021/nn901297q,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn901297q,,,,,,,,20180585,,,,,WOS:000275858200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We developed injectable formulations that form gels entrapping magnetic particles into a tumor. We used SPIONs embedded in silica microparticles to favor syringeability and incorporated the highest proportion possible to allow large heating capacities. Hydrogel, single-solvent organogel and cosolvent (low-toxicity hydrophilic solvent) organogel formulations were injected into human cancer tumors xenografted in mice. The thermoreversible hydrogels (poloxamer, chitosan), which accommodated 20% w/v of the magnetic microparticles, proved to be inadequate. Alginate hydrogels, however, incorporated 10% w/v of the magnetic microparticles, and the external gelation led to strong implants localizing to the tumor periphery, whereas internal gelation failed in situ. The organogel formulations, which consisted of precipitating polymers dissolved in single organic solvents, displayed various microstructures. A 8% poly(ethylene-vinyl alcohol) in DMSO containing 40% w/v of magnetic microparticles formed the most suitable implants in terms of tumor casting and heat delivery. importantly, it is of great clinical interest to develop cosolvent formulations with up to 20% w/v of magnetic microparticles that show reduced toxicity and centered tumor implantation.

The uptake of AuNCs by the reticuloendothelial system is relatively low in comparison with other nanoparticle-based contrast imaging agents due to their ultrasmall hydrodynamic size (similar to 2.7 nm). Through the body weight change analysis, the results show that the body weight of the mice administrated with AuNCs has not been changed obviously in comparison with that of the control mice injected with PBS. Furthermore, using MDA-MB-45 and Hela tumor xenograft models, in vivo and ex vivo imaging studies show that the ultrasmall NIR AuNCs are able to be highly accumulated in the tumor areas, thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects.

In vitro binding assays confirmed the integrin-specific association between the RGD-particle adducts and U87MG glioblastoma cells. Successful tumor homing in vivo was perceived in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model by both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and NIRF imaging. Ex vivo histopathological studies also revealed low particle accumulation in the liver, which was attributed to their compact hydrodynamic size and PEGylated coating. In conclusion, we have developed a novel RGD-IONP conjugate with excellent tumor integrin targeting efficiency and specificity as well as limited RES uptake for molecular MRI.

Magnetic nanoparticles, which were functionalized to target a receptor commonly found in breast cancer cells, bound and captured circulating tumour cells under a magnet. To improve detection sensitivity and specificity, gold-plated carbon nanotubes conjugated with folic acid were used as a second contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging.

In vitro determined hydrodynamic diameter of similar to 100nm, saturation magnetization of 94 emu/g Fe and T-2 relaxivity of 43 s(-1) mM(-1) of the nanoparticles suggested their applicability for this purpose. In vivo effect of magnetic targeting on the extent and selectivity of nanoparticle accumulation in tumors of rats harboring orthotopic 9L-gliosarcomas was quantified with MRI. Animals were intravenously injected with nanoparticles (12mg Fe/kg) under a magnetic field density of 0T (control) or 0.4 T (experimental) applied for 30 min. MR images were acquired prior to administration of nanoparticles and immediately after magnetic targeting at I It intervals for 4h. Image analysis revealed that magnetic targeting induced a 5-fold increase in the total glioma exposure to magnetic nanoparticles over non-targeted tumors (p = 0.005) and a 3.6-fold enhancement in the target selectivity index of nanoparticle accumulation in glioma over the normal brain (p = 0.025). In conclusion, accumulation of iron oxide nanoparticles in gliosarcomas can be significantly enhanced by magnetic targeting and successfully quantified by MR imaging. Hence, these nanoparticles appear to be a promising vehicle for glioma-targeted drug delivery. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One class of such agents, composite nanodevices (CNDs), is multifunctional nanomaterials with several potential medical uses, including cancer imaging and therapy. Nanosized metal-dendrimer CNDs consist of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (in various sizes, surface substituents, and net charges) and inorganic nanoparticles, properties of both of which can be individually modified and optimized. In this study we examine effects of size and surface charge on the behavior of Au-dendrimer CNDs in mouse tumor models. Quantitative biodistribution and excretion analyses including 5-nm and 22-nm positive surface, 5-nm and 11-nm negative surface, and a 5-nm neutral surface CNDs were carried out in the B16 mouse melanoma tumor model system. Results seen with the 22-nm CND in the B16 melanoma model were corroborated in a prostate cancer mouse tumor model system. Quantitative in vivo studies confirm the importance of charge and show for the first time the importance of size in affecting CND biodistribution and excretion. Interestingly, CNDs of different size and/or surface charge had high levels of uptake (selective targeting) to certain organs without specific targeting moieties placed on their surfaces. We conclude that size and charge greatly affect biodistribution of CNDs. These findings have significance for the design of all particle-based nanodevices for medical uses. The observed organ selectivity may make these nanodevices exciting for several targeted medical applications.

Unlike dextrancoated cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles, which are prepared by a chemical cross-linking method, TCLSPION are prepared by a simple, thermal cross-linking method using a Si-OH-containing copolymer. The copolymer, poly(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-r-PEG methyl ether methacrylate-r-N-acryloxysuccinimide), was synthesized by radical polymerization and used as a coating material for as-synthesized magnetite (Fe3O4) SPION. The polymer-coated SPION was further heated at 80 degrees C to induce cross-linking between the -Si(OH)(3) groups in the polymer chains, which finally generated TCL-SPION bearing a carboxyl group as a surface functional group. The particle size, surface charge, presence of polymer-coating layers, and the extent of thermal cross-linking were characterized and confirmed by various measurements, including dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The carboxyl TCL-SPION was converted to amine-modified TCL-SPION and then finally to Cy5.5 dyeconjugated TCL-SPION for use in dual (magnetic resonance/optical) in vivo cancer imaging. When the Cy5.5 TCL-SPION was administered to Lewis lung carcinoma tumor allograft mice by intravenous injection, the tumor was unambiguously detected in T-2-weighted magnetic resonance images as a 68% signal drop as well as in optical fluorescence images within 4 h, indicating a high level of accumulation of the nanomagnets within the tumor site. In addition, ex vivo fluorescence images of the harvested tumor and other major organs further confirmed the highest accumulation of the Cy5.5 TCL-SPION within the tumor.

Here, we describe a new CT contrast agent based on gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that overcomes these limitations. Because gold has a higher atomic number and X-ray absorption coefficient than iodine, we expected that GNPs can be used as CT contrast agents. We prepared uniform GNPs (similar to 30 nm in diameter) by general reduction of HAuCl4 by boiling with sodium citrate. The resulting GNPs were coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to impart antibiofouling properties, which extends their lifetime in the bloodstream. Measurement of the X-ray absorption coefficient in vitro revealed that the attenuation of PEG-coated GNPs is 5.7 times higher than that of the current iodine-based CT contrast agent, Ultravist. Furthermore, when injected intravenously into rats, the PEG-coated GNPs had a much longer blood circulation time (> 4 h) than Ultravist (< 10 min). Consequently, CT images of rats using PEG-coated GNPs showed a clear delineation of cardiac ventricles and great vessels. On the other hand, relatively high levels of GNPs accumulated in the spleen and liver, which contain phagocytic cells. Intravenous injection of PEG-coated GNPs into hepatoma-bearing rats resulted in a high contrast (similar to 2-fold) between hepatoma and normal liver tissue on CT images. These results suggest that PEG-coated GNPs can be useful as a CT contrast agent for a blood pool and hepatoma imaging.",,,,,"Jon, Sangyong/C-3725-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-7863,1520-5126,,,,20-Jun,2007,129,24,,,,,7661,7665,,10.1021/ja071471p,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja071471p,,,,,,,,17530850,,,,,WOS:000247240500037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized using two different preparation methods ( in situ and stepwise, respectively) were both well dispersed in PBS buffer at a variety of pH conditions ( pH 1-10). In addition, dynamic light scattering data revealed that their sizes were not altered even after 24 h of incubation in 10% serum containing cell culture medium, indicative of a lack of protein adsorption on their surfaces. When the antibiofouling polymer-coated SPION were incubated with macrophage cells, uptake was significantly lower in comparison to that of the popular contrast agent, Feridex I. V., suggesting that the polymer-coated SPION can be long-circulated in plasma by escaping from uptake by the reticular endothelial system ( RES) such as macrophages.

This character can be exploited for improving the selectivity of radiotherapy. However, such an improvement is possible only if irradiation is performed when the gold content is high in the tumor and low in the surrounding healthy tissue. As a result, the beneficial action of irradiation (the eradication of the tumor) should occur while the deleterious side effects of radiotherapy should be limited by sparing the healthy tissue. The location of the radiosensitizers is therefore required to initiate the radiotherapy. Designing gold nanoparticles for monitoring their distribution by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an asset due to the high resolution of MRI which permits the accurate location of particles and therefore the determination of the optimal time for the irradiation. We recently demonstrated that ultrasmall gold nanoparticles coated by gadolinium chelates (Au@DTDTPA-Gd) can be followed up by MRI after intravenous injection. Herein, Au@DTDTPA and Au@DTDTPA-Gd were prepared in order to evaluate their potential for radiosensitization. Comet assays and in vivo experiments suggest that these particles appear well suited for improving the selectivity of the radiotherapy. The dose which is used for inducing similar levels of DNA alteration is divided by two when cells are incubated with the gold nanoparticles prior to the irradiation. Moreover, the increase in the lifespan of tumor bearing rats is more important when the irradiation is performed after the injection of the gold nanoparticles. In the case of treatment of rats with a brain tumor (9L gliosarcoma, a radio-resistant tumor in a radiosensitive organ), the delay between the intravenous injection and the irradiation was determined by MRI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26-Mar,2014,10,6,,,,,1116,1124,,10.1002/smll.201470036,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.201470036,,,,,,,,24659273,,,,,,
