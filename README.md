Abstract

## Supervised Machine Learning
Runs in Python 3.9 using algorithms from scikit-learn and XGBoost. tqdm is a useful tool to visually track computing progress. A fresh conda environment can be set up using

```
conda create -n NanoAI python=3.9
conda activate NanoAI
conda install scikit-learn
conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost
conda install tqdm
```
